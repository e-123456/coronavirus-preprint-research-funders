    "abstract": "We propose an efficient framework for genetic subtyping of a pandemic virus, with application to the novel 2 coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Efficient identification of subtypes is particularly important for tracking the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of infectious spread in real-time. In this paper, we utilize an 4 entropy analysis to identify nucleotide sites within SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences that are highly informative of genetic variation, and thereby define an Informative Subtype Marker (ISM) for each sequence. 6\nWe further apply an error correction technique to the ISMs, for more robust subtype definition given ambiguity and noise in sequence data. We show that, by analyzing the ISMs of global SARS-CoV-2 sequence 8 data, we can distinguish interregional differences in viral subtype distribution, and track the emergence of 9 subtypes in different regions over time. Based on publicly available data up to April 5, 2020, we show, for 10 example: (1) distinct genetic subtypes of infections in Europe, with earlier transmission linked to subtypes prevalent in Italy with later development of subtypes specific to other countries over time; (2) within the",
