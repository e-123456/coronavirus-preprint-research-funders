    "abstract": "Background & Aims: Cumulating observations have indicated that COVID-19 patients undergo different patterns of abnormal liver chemistries. We performed a meta-analysis of  according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Meta-Analyses. We analyzed pooled data on liver chemistries stratified by the severity of COVID-19 using a fixed or random effects model. Results: In a meta-analysis of 37 studies, comprising 6,235 patients, the pooled mean of ALT was 36.4 IU/L in the severe cases of COVID-19 while 27.8 IU/L in the non-severe cases (95% CI: -9.4- -5.1, p<0.0001). Pooled average of AST was 46.8 IU/L in the severe cases while 30.4 IU/L in the non-severe cases (95% CI: -15.1- -10.4, p<0.0001). Compared with the non-severe cases, the severe cases tended to have higher \u03b3-Glutamyltransferase while lower albumin. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, we comprehensively described three patterns of liver impairment related to COVID-19, including hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and synthetic disfunction, according to the severity of the COVID-19. Patients with abnormal liver tests are at higher risks of progressing to severe disease. Close monitoring on liver chemistries helps to early warn against disease progression.\nCompeting Interest Statement\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.\nFunding Statement\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China No.81871645 (JSP).
