    "abstract": "Here, we report on five patients whose hospitalizations for COVID-19 were complicated by venous thromboembolism (VTE). All demonstrated high levels of D-dimer as well as high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios. For four patients we were able to test sera for neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) remnants and found significantly elevated levels of cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, and citrullinated histone H3. Neutrophil-derived S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) was also elevated. Given strong links between hyperactive neutrophils, NET release, and thrombosis in many inflammatory diseases, the potential relationship between NETs and VTE should be urgently investigated in COVID-19.",
