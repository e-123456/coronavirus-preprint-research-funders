    "abstract": "COVID-19 is an emerging and rapidly evolving pandemic around the world, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome and results in substantial morbidity and mortality. To examine the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and its interactions with some exogenous factors such as limited medical resources and false detection problems, we employ a simple epidemiological model and analyse this system using modelling and dynamical systems techniques. We discover some contrasting findings with respect to the observations of basic reproduction number, and we investigate how the issues of limited medical resources and false detection problems affect the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
