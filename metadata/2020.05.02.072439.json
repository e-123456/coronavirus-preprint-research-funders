    "abstract": "COVID-2019 has progressed in around 10-15% of patients to an acute respiratory distress syndrome characterized by extensive pulmonary inflammation and elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Neutrophil activation seems to be crucial in the initiation and perpetuation of this exacerbated lung inflammation. However, the precise mechanisms by which this activation occurs remain yet elusive. To this end, this in silico study tried to identify potential proinflammatory inducing peptides (PIPs) produced by the action of the elastase released in neutrophil-extracellular traps over SARS-CoV-2 particles. We found nine potential PIPs exclusive from the SARS-CoV-2, showing homology against T cell recognition epitopes. Moreover, 78 percent of these exclusive PIPs were found produced by the enzymatic cleavage on the spike glycoproteins, suggesting that high PIP concentrations might be released following SARS-CoV-2 huge replication rate. Therefore, these PIPs might play a role in the exacerbated inflammatory response observed in some patients.",
