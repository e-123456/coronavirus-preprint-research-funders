    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by emerging SARS-CoV-2, has posed serious threats to global public health, economic and social stabilities, calling for the prompt development of therapeutics and prophylactics. In this study, we firstly verified that SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a cell receptor and its spike (S) protein mediates high membrane fusion activity. Comparing to that of SARS-CoV, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased \u03b1-helicity and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 (HR1) site. Then, we designed a HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed IPB02, which showed highly poent activities in inibibiting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus infection. IPB02 also inhibited the SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the strcuture and activity relationship (SAR) of IPB02 were characterzized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities. Therefore, the presented results have provided important information for understanding the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 and the design of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step.",
