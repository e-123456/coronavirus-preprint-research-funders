    "abstract": "Coronaviruses such as the newly discovered virus from Wuhan, China, 2019-nCoV, and the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, have resulted in regional and global public health emergencies. Based on our molecular insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication mechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) for the treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit the above coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV. To develop broad spectrum anti-viral agents, we further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3\u2019-blocking groups that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase terminators.\nThe recent appearance of clusters of a new coronaviral infection in Wuhan, China has made headlines, as more and more people have become infected in China and in a number of other countries. Already more than 100 deaths have been ascribed to this virus, and there are fears of additional outbreaks. The virus has been isolated from the lower respiratory tracts of patients with pneumonia, sequenced and visualized by electron microscopy (Zhu et al 2020). The virus, which has received the placeholder name 2019-nCoV, turns out to be a new member of the subgenus sarbecovirus, in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, but is distinct from MERS CoV and SARS CoV (Zhu et al 2020). The coronaviruses are positive-sense, single strand RNA viruses, and thus share properties with other single-stranded RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus, West Nile virus, Marburg virus, HIV virus, Ebola virus, dengue virus, and rhinoviruses.",
