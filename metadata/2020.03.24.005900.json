    "abstract": "Based on genome-scale loss-of-function screens we discovered that Topoisomerase III-\u00df (TOP3B), a human topoisomerase that acts on DNA and RNA, is required for yellow fever virus and dengue virus-2 replication. Remarkably, we found that TOP3B is required for efficient replication of all positive-sense-single stranded RNA viruses tested, including SARS-CoV-2. While there are no drugs that specifically inhibit this topoisomerase, we posit that TOP3B is an attractive anti-viral target.",
