This assay did not demonstrate cross 35 reaction in any of the 28 samples from patients with common human coronaviruses, 36 including types HKU, NL, CV229E, and OC",

    "abstract": "In December 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged as the cause of severe respiratory disease and quickly spread causing a worldwide pandemic. Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was determined to be the agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family, which also includes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 (SARS44 CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (1). For diagnostic purposes many nucleic acid amplification assays were quickly developed and received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Multiple manufacturers are offering serological assays, but few have received Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); the EUROIMMUN IgG assay has received Emergency Use Authorization.",
