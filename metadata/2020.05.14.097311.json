    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in December and has quickly become a worldwide pandemic. In response, many diagnostic manufacturers have developed molecular assays for SARS-CoV-2 under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency\nUse Authorization (EUA) pathway. This study compared three of these assays: the Hologic Panther Fusion",
