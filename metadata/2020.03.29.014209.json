    "abstract": "2 Bats are responsible for the zoonotic transmission of several major viral diseases including the 3 2003 SARS outbreak and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While bat genomic sequencing 4 studies have revealed characteristic adaptations of the innate immune system, functional genomic 5 studies are urgently needed to provide a foundation for the molecular dissection of the tolerance 6 of viral infections in bats. Here we report the establishment and screening of genome-wide RNAi 7 library and CRISPR library for the model megabat, Pteropus Alecto. We used the complementary 8 RNAi and CRISPR libraries to interrogate Pteropus Alecto cells for infection with two different 9 viruses, mumps virus and Influenza A virus, respectively. Screening results converged on the endocytosis pathway and the protein secretory pathway as required for both viral infections. Additionally, we revealed a general dependence of the C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase gene, MTHFD1, for viral replication in bat cells as well as in human cells. MTHFD1 inhibitor carolacton potently blocked replication of several RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our studies provide a resource for systematic inquiry into the genetic underpinnings of bat biology and a potential target for developing broad spectrum antiviral therapy. 17 As the only mammal capable of sustained flying, bats are intriguing animals with unique behavioral and physiological characteristics. Bats are notorious for transmission of deadly viruses, causing the epidemics of the Ebola1, SARS2, Henipavirus3, MERS4 and COVID-195,6. Bats are widely considered the largest reservoir of numerous virus species but are resilient to the diseases associated with many of these viruses7,8. How bats tolerate the infections with these viruses is of intense interest due to the scientific and public health relevance. Genomic sequencing studies have revealed several genetic adaptions underlying this tolerance of viral infections. For example, the DNA damage checkpoint pathway and the NF-kB pathway are known to be positively selected in the bat genomes9. In addition, in the type I interferon gene family, the MHC class I genes and natural killer cell receptor family have been reported to be highly expanded in the bat genomes10. These studies provided evidence to support the hypothesis that bats have evolved a highly specific genetic configuration, especially in the innate immunity pathways. A major caveat is the lack of systematic examination of the functions of these genes due to shortage of functional genomic tools.",

        "so that na\u00efve PaKi cells all died before the 9th day post infection. We then collected the surviving cells and compared sgRNA abundance with mock-infected cells. The two replicates demonstrated a high correlation, indicating high reproducibility (Supplementary Fig. 2). We calculated the results using the RIGER algorithm and identified 21 host factors required for the viral infection or pathogenesis20 (Fig. 1b). Three of the top four hits belong to the V-type proton ATPase subunits (ATP6V1B2, ATP6V1F and ATP6V0D1), which are involved in the acidification of endosome and have previously been previous identified as key host factors for influenza virus entry in several screens performed in human cells (Fig. 1b)21. Among the other hits were two genes, COPZ1 and",

The effect is similar to the knockdown of SEC61B, a well-studied host protein required for viral replication and a top hit in our RNAi screen (Fig. 2d and 2e)23. We additionally tested Melaka virus (PRV3M), a pteropine orthoreovirus that causes acute respiratory disease when transmitted by bats to humans28. PRV3M titer was also significantly reduced by MTHFD1 knockdown (Fig. 2e and 2f). Infection of Zika virus, a member of the flavivirus family, was also inhibited by MTHFD1 knockdown using siRNA (Fig. 2g). Alternative knockdown with stable expression of two shRNAs validated the requirement of MTHFD1 for the replication of mumps virus and Zika virus (Fig. 2h, 2i and 2j). Importantly, we also show that this inhibition is completely rescued by overexpression of MTHFD1 from a construct resistant to the shRNA, ruling out potential off-target effects (Fig. 2k).",

In contrast, supplementation of methyl-group donor or thymidine had little effect on viral replication, evidence that it is the purine synthesis activity of MTHFD1 that is essential for the viral replication (Fig. 3d). To further pinpoint the enzymatic function of MTHFD1 in viral replication, we performed gene complementation experiments in an shRNA cell line with over 90% knockdown of MTHFD1 (Fig. 2i). The block of Zika virus replication in this cell line was completely rescued by overexpression of an shRNA-resistant MTHFD1 construct or bat homolog (Fig. 3f and 3g).",
