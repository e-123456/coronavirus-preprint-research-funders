Spike (S) protein of coronavirus is the primary determinant of its entry into the host as it consists of both receptor binding and fusion domain. While tissue tropism, host range, and pathogenesis of coronavirus are primarily controlled by the interaction of S protein with the cell receptor, it is possible that proteolytic activation of S",
