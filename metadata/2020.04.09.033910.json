    "author": "COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While the pathophysiology of this deadly virus is complex and largely unknown, we employ a network biology-fueled approach and integrated multiomics data pertaining to lung epithelial cells-specific coexpression network and human interactome to generate Calu-3-specific human-SARSCoV-2 Interactome (CSI). Topological clustering and pathway enrichment analysis show that SARS-CoV-2 target central nodes of host-viral network that participate in core functional pathways. Network centrality analyses discover 28 high-value SARS-CoV-2 targets, which are possibly involved in viral entry, proliferation and survival to establish infection and facilitate disease progression. Our probabilistic modeling framework elucidates critical regulatory circuitry and molecular events pertinent to COVID-19, particularly the host modifying responses and cytokine storm. Overall, our network centric analyses reveal novel molecular components, uncover structural and functional modules, and provide molecular insights into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity",

        "While majority of the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop a mild to moderate self-resolving respiratory illness, infants and older adults (\u2265 65 years) as well as patients with preexisting medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, renal dysfunction, obesity and cancer are more vulnerable 2",
        "The pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 is complex and largely unknown but is associated with an extensive immune reaction referred to as \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 triggered by the excessive production of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and others. The cytokine release syndrome leads to extensive tissue damage and multiple organ failure",

    "abstract": "Networks encompass a set of nodes and edges, also referred as vertices and links, respectively. Nodes are systems components, whereas edges represent the interactions or relationships among the nodes 5, 6. In biological systems, genes and their products perform their functions by interacting with other molecular components within the cell. For instance, proteins directly or indirectly interact with each other under both steady-state and different stress conditions to form static and dynamic complexes, and participate in diverse signaling cascades, distinct cellular pathways and a wide spectrum of biological processes. Proteome scale maps of such protein-protein interactions are referred to as interactomes 5, 6.",
