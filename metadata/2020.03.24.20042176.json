    "abstract": "Objective:To analyse the clinical features of COVID\u221219 parturients, and to compare anaesthetic regimen and clinical outcomes in parturients with or without COVID\u221219 undergoing cesarean delivery.Methods: Data were extracted from the electronic medical record of 3 medical institutions in Hubei Province, China, from June 1, 2019 to March 20, 2020 according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. After propensity score matching with demographics, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of parturients with or without COVID\u221219 were analysed. The anaesthetic regimen and clinical outcomes of themselves and their infants were compared in these two groups of parturients. Results: A total of 1,588 patients without SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 infection undergoing cesarean delivery were retrospectively included. After achieving a balanced cohort through propensity score matching, 89 patients (COVID\u221219 group), who were diagnosed with COVID\u221219 by SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 nucleic acid test and CT scan matched with 173 patients without COVID\u221219 (Control group). The SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 infected parturients in the early stages of COVID\u221219 outbreak was much more than during the later stage. The main clinical characteristics of parturients with COVID\u221219 were fever (34.8%), cough (33.7%), an increased plasma CRP (52.8%) and a decreased lymphocyte counting (33.7%). A high rate of emergency and a high incidence of anaesthesia-related complications, such as pharyngalgia, multiple puncture, intraoperative hypotension, nausea, vomiting, vertigo and chills in the COVID\u221219 parturients. In addition, the parturients with COVID\u221219 had a long duration of operation and hospital stay, and an increased intraoperative oxytocin utilization and postoperative oxygen therapy. The newborns from the SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 infected mothers, who received general anaesthesia, had a high risk of Apgar score \u22648 at 1 and 5 minutes after delivery and a higher rate of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. Conclusions: Anaesthesia\u2212related complications occur more frequently in the COVID\u221219 parturients and their newborns have a high risk of distress.",
