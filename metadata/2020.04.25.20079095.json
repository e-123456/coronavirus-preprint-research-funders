    "abstract": "Background: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which initially started as a cluster of pneumonia cases in the Wuhan city of China has now become a full blown pandemic. Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is the key in containing the pandemic and breaking the chain of In low and middle income countries availability of testing kits has become the major bottle neck in testing. Novel methods like pooling of samples are the need of the hour. Method: Extracted RNA samples were randomly placed in pools of 8 on a 96 well plate. Both individual RNA (ID) and pooled RNA RT-qPCR for the screening E gene were done in the same plate and the positivity for the E gene was seen. Results: The present study demonstrated that pool testing with 8 RNA samples can easily detect even up to a single positive sample with Ct value as high as 38. The present study also showed that the results of pool testing is not affected by number of positive samples in a pool. Conclusion: Pooling of 8 RNA samples can reduce the time and expense by one eighth, and can help expand diagnostic capabilities, especially during constrained supply of reagents and PCR kits for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
