    "abstract": "We report here on antigens from the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein, that when presented by Class I MHC, can lead to cytotoxic CD8+ T cell anti-viral responses in COVID-19 patients. We present a method in which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is converted into a library of peptide antigen-Major Histocompatibility Complexes (pMHCs) as single chain trimers that contain the peptide antigen, the MHC HLA allele, and the \u03b2-2 microglobulin sub-unit. That library is used to detect the evolution of virus-specific T cell populations from two COVID-19 patients, at two time points over the course of infection. Both patients exhibit similar virus-specific T cell populations, but very different time-trajectories of those populations. These results can be used to track those virus-specific T cell populations over the course of an infection, thus providing deep insight into the variations in immune system trajectories observed in different COVID-19 patients.",
