    "abstract": "Essential industrial sectors, healthcare systems, and government agencies must continue operations despite the risk of COVID-19 infection. They need tools to assess risks associated with operations, so they can devise emergency plans. We developed a population-based simulator to study COVID-19 outbreaks in enclosed environments and evaluate the effectiveness of preventative measures and action plans, such as pre-dispatch quarantine and removal of symptomatic cases.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
