    "abstract": "The infection of SARS-CoV-2 has spread to more than 200 countries and regions and the numbers of infected people and deaths worldwide are expected to continue to rise. Current treatment of COVID-19 is limited and mostly supportive. At present, there is no specific therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we discovered that protoporphyrin IX and verteporfin, two FDA-approved drugs for treatment of human diseases, had significant antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2, with EC50 values for the reduction of viral RNA at nanomolar concentrations. Both drugs completely inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) produced by SARS-CoV-2 infection at lower drug concentrations than that of remdesivir. The selection indices of protoporphyrin IX and verteporfin are 952.74 and 368.93, respectively, suggesting wide safety margins. Both drugs were able to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as suppress established SARS-CoV-2 infection. The compounds share a porphyrin ring structure. Molecular docking indicates that the compounds may interact with viral receptor ACE2 and could block the cell-cell fusion mediated by ACE2 and viral S protein. Our finding suggests that protoporphyrin IX and verteporfin might be potential antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection and also sheds new light on the development of a novel class of small compounds against SARS-CoV-2.",
