    "abstract": "In this work we observe a number of cases supporting the possible correlation between the administration of BCG tuberculosis vaccine and the severity of Covid-19 effects in the population proposed in the earlier works [1]. Based on the early prelimi-nary analysis of the publicly available data we propose a number of arguments and observations providing further support for the correlation hypothesis and make an observation that the effectiveness of the protection effect of BCG im-munization, if confirmed, may depend to a significant extent on the age of admin-istration, with the early age inoculation more effective for the lasting protection..\nCompeting Interest Statement\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.",
