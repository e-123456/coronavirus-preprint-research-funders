    "abstract": "Targeted immunization or attacks of large-scale networks has attracted significant attention by the scientific community. However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only n nodes are observed at a time and the most central between these n nodes is immunized (or attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until 1-p fraction of nodes are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this approach and determine the critical percolation threshold pc and the size of the giant component P\u221e for networks with arbitrary degree distributions P(k). In the limit of n\u2192\u221e we recover prior work on targeted attack, whereas for n=1 we recover the known case of random failure. Between these two extremes, we observe that as n increases, pc increases quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between |pc(\u221e) -pc (n)| and n as |pc(\u221e) -pc (n)|~n-1exp(-\u03b1 n). For Scale-free (SF) networks, where P(k)~k-\u03b3,2pc has a transition from zero to non-zero when n increases from n=1 to order of logN (N is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks, knowledge of order of logN nodes and immunizing them can reduce dramatically an epidemics.",
