    "abstract": "A novel pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), which caused by SARS-CoV-2 and broken in Wuhan, China in the end of 2019. Unfortunately, there is no specific antiviral agent or vaccine available to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. Also, information regarding the immunological characteristics in COVID-19 patients remains limited. Here we collected the blood samples from 18 healthy donors (HD) and 38 COVID-19 patients to analyze changes in \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. In comparison to HD, the \u03b3\u03b4 T cells percentage was decreased. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are able to immediately respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection and upregulate the activation marker CD25. In addition, the increased expression of CD4 in \u03b3\u03b4 T cells may serve as a biomarker for the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
