    "abstract": "Data on people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still scarce. This case series of 33 PLWH patients with COVID-19 reveals symptoms and outcome in this special population. Three out of 32 patients with documented outcome died (9%). However, 91% of the patients recovered and 76% have been classified as mild cases, indicating that there is no excess morbidity and mortality among PLWH with symptomatic COVID-19. All patients were on antiretroviral treatment, of them 22 on tenofovir-containing regimen, and 4 on the protease inhibitor darunavir.",
