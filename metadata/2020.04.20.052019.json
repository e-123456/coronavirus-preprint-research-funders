    "abstract": "2 Human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is most closely 3 related, by average genetic distance, to two coronaviruses isolated from bats, RaTG13 and 4 RmYN02. However, there is a segment of high amino acid similarity between human SARS5 CoV-2 and a pangolin isolated strain, GD410721, in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of 6 the spike protein, a pattern that can be caused by either recombination or by convergent 7 amino acid evolution driven by natural selection. We perform a detailed analysis of the 8 synonymous divergence, which is less likely to be affected by selection than amino acid 9 divergence, between human SARS-CoV-2 and related strains. We show that the synonymous divergence between the bat derived viruses and SARS-CoV-2 is larger than between GD410721 and SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD, providing strong additional support for the recombination hypothesis. However, the synonymous divergence between pangolin strain and SARS-CoV-2 is also relatively high, which is not consistent with a recent recombination between them, instead it suggests a recombination into RaTG13. We also find a 14-fold increase in the dN/dS ratio from the lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 to the strains of the current pandemic, suggesting that the vast majority of non-synonymous mutations currently segregating within the human strains have a negative impact on viral fitness. Finally, we estimate that the time to the most recent common ancestor of SARS19 CoV-2 and RaTG13 or RmYN02 based on synonymous divergence, is 51.71 years (95% C.I., 28.11-75.31) and 37.02 years (95% C.I., 18.19-55.85), respectively. 22 Introduction The Covid19 pandemic is perhaps the biggest public health and economic threat that the world has faced for decades (Li, et al. 2020; Wu, et al. 2020; Zhou, Yang, et al. 2020).
