    "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic represents a major challenge to health systems of all countries. Brazilian regions habe been showing marked di\ufb00erences in onset and number of cases. Health authorities instituted widespread social distancing and lockdown measures but their implementation has also varied. The authors used data on con\ufb01rmed cases of COVID-19 in Brazil and its states to calculate the value of instantaneous reproduction number at these regions. The results show a reduction of instantaneous reproduction number with time, probably due to social distancing measures put in place in the last weeks by brazillian authorities. It seems logical to maintain restrictions to social contact until the epidemic peak has occurred in Brazil.",
