    "abstract": "Since December 8, 2019, the spread of COVID-19 is increasing every day. It is particularly important to predict the trend of the epidemic for the timely adjustment of the economy and industries. We proposed a Flow-SEHIR model, based on which we performed the trends of 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) in China. The results show the basic reproductive numbers R0 of COVID-19 is 3.56 (95% CI: 2.31 - 4.81). The number of daily confirmed new cases reaches the inflection point on Feb. 6 - 10 outside Hubei. For the maximum of infected cases number, the predicted peak value in China except Hubei was estimated to be 13806 (95% CI: 11926 - 15845). The peak arrival time is on March 3 - 9. The peak cumulative number of patients in Hubei was estimated to be 63800 (95% CI: 59300 - 76500). The temporal number of patients in most areas of China outside Hubei will peak from March 12th to March 15th, 2020. The peak values of more than 73.5% provinces or regions in China will be controlled within 1000.",
