    "abstract": "Currently, a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV causes an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Little is known about its epidemiological characteristics. Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 (5.6 - 7.7, 95% CI) days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). These values help to inform case definitions for 2019-nCoV and appropriate durations for quarantine.",
