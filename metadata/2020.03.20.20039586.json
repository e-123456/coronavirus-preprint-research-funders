    "abstract": "Background The novel coronavirus (CoV) severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 outbreak started at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread over 100 countries. SARS-CoV-2 uses the membrane protein Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. Indeed, it was reported that the balance of Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), regulated by both ACE and ACE2, was altered in COVID-19 patients. It is controversial, however, whether commonly used anti-hypertensive drugs Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) shall be continued in the confirmed COVID-19 patients. This study was designed to investigate any difference in disease severity between COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity. The included COVID-19 patients used ACEI, ARB, calcium channel blockers (CCB), beta blockers (BB), or thiazide to treat preexisting hypertension prior to the hospital were compared to patients who did not take any of those drugs.",

            "funding-statement": "Funding National Natural Science Foundation of China, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Research in context Evidence before this study We searched PubMed for articles published up to March 15, 2020 using keywords \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d, \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d, and COVID-19 AND \u201cARB\u201d, and \u201cangiotensin II receptor blocker\u201d for papers published in both English and Chinese. We found three papers: one from our group, published in Science China Life Science that demonstrated an elevated Angiotensin II level in blood samples from COVID-19 patients; another a perspective article in Chinese recommending ACEI and ARBs as potential remedies for SARS-CoV-2 infections; the third a retrospective study in Chinese identifying no significant difference between ACEI/ARB associated with outcomes in 112 COVID-19 patients with CVD comorbidity. The International society of Hypertension stated on March 16th, 2020: \u201cthere are no clinical data in human to show that ACE-inhibitors or ARBs either improve or worsen susceptibility to COVID-19 infection nor do they affect the outcomes of those infected\u201d. Added value of this study We retrospectively reviewed different types of anti-hypertensive drugs taken by COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity prior to entering the hospital. We discovered that ARB hypertensive drugs were associated with a decreased risk of severe disease in elderly (age>65) COVID-19 patients (OR=0\u00b7343, 95% CI 0\u00b7128-0\u00b7916, p=0\u00b7025), the first evidence of ARBs association to COVID-19 infections in human. We conducted a meta-analysis in the literature and found that ARB has positive effects associated with morbidity and mortality of pneumonia."
