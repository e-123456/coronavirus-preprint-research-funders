    "abstract": "At this moment, the world leaves under the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak pandemic. As Otolaryngologists - Head & Neck Surgeons, we need to perform and participate in examinations and procedures within the head and neck region and airway that are at particularly high risk of exposure and infection because of aerosol and droplet contamination. One of those surgical procedures on demand at this moment is tracheostomy, due the increasing admission in ICU departments and the increased need of ventilatory support secondary to respiratory distress syndrome. This review of international guidelines for tracheostomy in COVID-19 infected patients, aiming to summarize in a systematic way the available recommendations from 18 guidelines from all over the world.",
