    "abstract": "A novel coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of a massive outbreak of atypical pneumonia originating at Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Involved in the formation of the coronavirus replication complex, the viral main protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro) represents an attractive target for therapy. We determined the crystal structure of the unliganded Mpro at 1.75 \u00c5 resolution and used this structure to guide optimization of a series of alpha-ketoamide inhibitors. The main goal of the optimization efforts was improvement of the pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds. We further describe 1.95- and 2.20-\u00c5 crystal structures of the complex between the enzyme and the most potent alpha-ketoamide optimized this way. These structures will form the basis for further development of these compounds to antiviral drugs.",
