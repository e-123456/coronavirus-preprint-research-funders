    "abstract": "We report a case of acute myelitis in a patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A 66-year-old man with coronavirus disease 2019 was admitted with acute flaccid paralysis of the bilateral lower limbs and urinary and bowel incontinence. All serum microbiological test results were negative, except for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. Clinical findings indicated post-infectious acute myelitis. He received treatment containing ganciclovir, lopinavir/ritonavir, moxifloxacin, dexamethasone, human immunoglobulin, and mecobalamin. With a diagnosis of post-infectious acute myelitis and comprehensive treatment, paralysis of the bilateral lower extremities ameliorated. After two negative novel coronavirus RNA nasopharyngeal swab tests, he was discharged and transferred to a designated hospital for isolation and rehabilitation therapy.",
