    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health and well-being of the global population. A vital step in the combat towards COVID-19 is a successful screening of contaminated patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiological imaging using chest radiography. This study aimed to automatically detect COVID\u201019 pneumonia patients using digital chest x\u2010ray images while maximizing the accuracy in detection using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). The dataset consists of 864 COVID\u201019, 1345 viral pneumonia and 1341 normal chest x\u2010ray images. In this study, DCNN based model Inception V3 with transfer learning have been proposed for the detection of coronavirus pneumonia infected patients using chest X-ray radiographs and achieved more than 96% accuracy. The results demonstrate that transfer learning proved to be effective, showed robust performance and easily deployable approach for COVID-19 detection.",
