    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 recently emerged, resulting a global pandemic. Rapid genomic information is critical to understanding transmission and pathogenesis. Here, we describe validated protocols for generating high-quality full-length genomes from primary samples. The first employs multiplex RT-PCR followed by MinION or MiSeq sequencing. The second uses singleplex, nested RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing.",
