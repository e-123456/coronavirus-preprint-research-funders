    "abstract": "Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus. Exponential growth is not only threatening lives, but also impacting businesses and disrupting travel around the world. Aim: The aim of this work is to develop an efficient diagnosis of COVID-19 disease by differentiating it from viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia and healthy cases using deep learning techniques. Method: In this work, we have used pre-trained knowledge to improve the diagnostic performance using transfer learning techniques and compared the performance different CNN architectures. Results: Evaluation results using K-fold (10) showed that we have achieved state of the art performance with overall accuracy of 98.75% on the perspective of CT and X-ray cases as a whole. Conclusion: Quantitative evaluation showed high accuracy for automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Pre-trained deep learning models develop in this study could be used early screening of coronavirus, however it calls for extensive need to CT or X-rays dataset to develop a reliable application.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
