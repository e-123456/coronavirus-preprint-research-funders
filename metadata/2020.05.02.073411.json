    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens global public health and economy. In order to develop safe and effective vaccines, suitable animal models must be established. Here we report the rapid adaption of SARS-CoV-2 in BALB/c mice, based on which a convenient, economical and effective animal model was developed. Specifically, we found that mouse-adapted SARSCoV-2 at passage 6 (MACSp6) efficiently infected both aged and young wild-type BALB/c mice, resulting in moderate pneumonia as well as inflammatory responses. The elevated infectivity of MACSp6 in mice could be attributed to the substitution of a key residue (N501Y) in the receptorbinding domain (RBD). Using this novel animal model, we further evaluated the in vivo protective efficacy of an RBD-based SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine, which elicited highly potent neutralizing antibodies and conferred full protection against SARS-CoV-2 MACSp6 challenge. This novel mouse model is convenient and effective in evaluating the in vivo protective efficacy of SARSCoV-2 vaccine. Summary This study describes a unique mouse model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and confirms protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 RBD subunit vaccine. Introduction A novel coronavirus (CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected millions of people with more than 139,000 deaths, leading to devastating damage to global public health and economy (1-6). Elderly COVID19 patients generally have a higher case-fatality rate (CFR) than the younger patients with COVID19, suggesting that aged people are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (7, 8).
