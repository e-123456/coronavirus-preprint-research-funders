    "abstract": "Prolific social media activity has accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. Health misinformation on social media may lead to harm from using toxic substances, especially in a pandemic where few vetted therapies exist. Here we show that social media activity on Twitter precedes increased exposure to bleach and other cleaning products. We analyzed tweets from the Greater Boston Area and compared them to calls to the Massachusetts and Rhode Island Poison Control Center. Social media activity accounted for 30-40% spikes in calls to poison control centers 2-3 days later. The time-lagged cross-correlation was only significant for tweets geotagged as from the Greater Boston area, strengthening the specificity of this relationship.",
