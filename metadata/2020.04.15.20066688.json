    "abstract": "We sought to assess whether HHFNC results in greater production of aerosolized particles than 6 liters per minute nasal cannula, using state-of-the-art techniques of aerosol measurement, in spontaneously breathing human volunteers in a simulated hospital room. For each volunteer, we first measured background aerosol levels in the room immediately prior to testing. We then measured aerosol levels while the healthy volunteer laid in bed - - with the head of bed at 30 degrees - - wearing the following oxygen delivery devices: (a) 6L/min nasal canula (NC) with humidification; (b) non-re-breather mask (NRB) with 15L/min gas flow, non-humidified; (c) HHFNC with 30L/min gas flow; (d) HHFNC with 60L/min gas flow. Two scanning mobility particle sizing (SMPS) systems (TSI 3080/3030, TSI 3080/3750) were used to measure aerosols 10 to 500 nanometer (nm) in size for each of the oxygen delivery devices. There was no variation in aerosol level within patients between room air, 6 L/min NC, 15 L/min NRB, 30 L/min HHFNC, and 60 L/min HHFNC, regardless of coughing.",
