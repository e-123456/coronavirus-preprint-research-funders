    "abstract": "In conclusion, there is moderate evidence that ACE2 variation is associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease with oesophagitis, and limited evidence of it having a strong role in other phenotypes in the absence of COVID-19. Homo/hemizygous LoF of ACE2\u200b appears to be infrequently tolerated and is likely extremely deleterious. Although LoF variants in ACE2\u200b are extremely rare, variants affecting the regions that interact with SARS-CoV-2 are more prevalent, and the impending research studies on human genetics and COVID-19 response may identify some of these variants as conferring resistance or heightened susceptibility to the virus.\nAcknowledgments",
