    "abstract": "The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originating from Wuhan, China, draws worldwide concerns due to its long incubation period and strong infectivity. Although RT-PCR-based molecular diagnosis techniques are being widely applied for clinical diagnosis currently, timely and accurate diagnosis are still limited due to labour intensive and time-consuming operations of these techniques. To address the issue, herein we report the synthesis of poly (amino ester) with carboxyl groups (PC)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (pcMNPs), and the development of pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction method for the sensitive detection of COVID-19 causing virus, the SARS-CoV-2. This method combines the lysis and binding steps into one step, and the pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent RT-PCR reactions. The simplified process can purify viral RNA from multiple samples within 20 min using a simple manual method or an automated high-throughput approach. By identifying two different regions (ORFlab and N gene) of viral RNA, a 10-copy sensitivity and a strong linear correlation between 10 and 105 copies of SARSCoV-2 pseudovirus particles are achieved. Benefitting from the simplicity and excellent performances, this new extraction method can dramatically reduce the turnaround time and operational requirements in current molecular diagnosis of COVID19, in particular for the early clinical diagnosis.",
