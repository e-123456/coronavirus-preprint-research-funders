    "abstract": "We study the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India using the SEIR compartmental model. After it's outbreak in Wuhan, China, it has been imported to India which is a densely populated country. India is fighting against this disease by ensuring nationwide social distancing. We estimate the infection rate to be 0.258 using a least square method with Poisson noise and estimate the reproduction number to be 2.58. We approximate the peak of the epidemic to be August 11, 2020. We estimate that a 25% drop in infection rate will delay the peak by 38 days for a 1 month intervention period. We estimate that the total individuals infected in India will be approximately 9% of the total population.",
