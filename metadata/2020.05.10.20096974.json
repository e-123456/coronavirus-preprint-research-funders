    "abstract": "COVID-19 disease has emerged as one of the life threatening threat to the society. It is caused by a novel beta coronavirus. It began as unidentified pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei province in China emerged in December 2019. No vaccine has been produced till now. Mathematical models are used to study impact of different measures used to decrease pandemic. Mathematical models have been designed to estimate the numbers of spreaders in different scenarios in the present manuscript. In the present manuscript, three different mathematical models have been proposed with different scenarios such as screening, quarantine and NPIs for estimating number of virus spreaders. the analysis shows that the numbers of COVID-19 patients will be more without screening the peoples coming from other countries. Since, every people suffering with COVID-19 disease are spreaders. The screening and quarantine with NPIs have been implemented to study their impact on the spreaders. It has been found that NPI measures are able to reduce number of spreaders. The NPI measures reduces the growth of the spread function and providing decision makers more time to prepare with in dealing of the disease.",
