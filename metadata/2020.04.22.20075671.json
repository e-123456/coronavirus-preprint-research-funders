    "abstract": "2 Background: Despite a paucity of clinical evidence, hydroxychloroquine and 3 azithromycin are being administered widely to patients with verified or suspected 4 COVID-19. Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated with QT 5 interval prolongation.\n6 Methods: We performed a case series of COVID-19 positive/suspected patients admitted 7 between 2/1/2020 and 4/4/2020 who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine 8 or a combination. We evaluated baseline and post-medication QT interval (QTc, Bazett\u2019s) 9 using 12-lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as: a) maximum QTc \u2265500 ms 10 (if QRS <120 ms) or QTc \u2265550 (if QRS \u2265120 ms) and b) increased QTc of \u226560 ms. Tisdale 11 score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated.",
