    "abstract": "We aim to test four one-step RT real-time mastermix options for use in SARS-CoV2 real-time PCR, with three primer/probe assays targeting the N gene. The lower limit of detection is determined using a SARS CoV2 N gene RNA transcript dilution series (to 1 copy/\u03bcl) and verified using 74 nose and throat swabs. The N2 assay demonstrates the most sensitive detection of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Three of the four mastermixes performed well , with the Takara One Step PrimeScriptTM III RT-PCR Kit mastermix demonstrating improved performance at the lower limit of detection.",
