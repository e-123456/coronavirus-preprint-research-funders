    "abstract": "BOX\nWhat is already know on this topic: \u2022 SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, associated with a high mortality rate, but may be asymptomatic in a still undefined fraction of individuals. \u2022 COVID-19 is associated with altered hematological, inflammatory and biochemical parameters, but the laboratory correlates of non-severe infection are unknown. \u2022 A severe COVID-19 outbreak severely hit Milan at the end of February 2020, but the number of infected individuals and risk factors remain unclear.\nWhat this study adds: \u2022 SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in Milan at the COVID-19 outbreak start on February 2020, with only 1 in 20 infected individuals being symptomatic and diagnosed. \u2022 Social distancing may have been more effective in reducing new infections in younger individuals, and by the end of April 4.4-10.8% of healthy asymptomatic adults had evidence of seroconversion. \u2022 Asymptomatic infection may affect lipid profile and be associated with higher circulating lymphocytes and eosinophils.",
