    "abstract": "We conducted a retrospective study among 417 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 1 to Feb 28, 2020 in Shenzhen, the largest migrant city of China, to identify the epidemiological and clinical features in settings of high population mobility. We estimated the median incubation time to be 5.0 days. 342 (82.0%) cases were imported, 161 (38.6%) cases were identified by surveillance, and 247 (59.2%) cases were reported from cluster events. The main symptoms on admission were fever and dry cough. Most patients (91.4%) had mild or moderate illnesses. Age of 50 years or older, breathing problems, diarrhea, and longer time between the first medical visit and admission were associated with higher level of clinical severity. Surveillance-identified cases were much less likely to progress to severe illness. Although the COVID-19 epidemic has been contained in Shenzhen, close monitoring and risk assessments are imperative for prevention and control of COVID-19 in future.",
