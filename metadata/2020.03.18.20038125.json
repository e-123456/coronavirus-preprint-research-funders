    "abstract": "Background: The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global threat. Identification of markers for symptom onset and disease progression is a pressing issue. We compared the clinical features on admission among patients who were diagnosed with asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19 at the end of observation. Methods: This retrospective, single-center study included 104 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from the mass infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship from February 11 to February 25, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory data, and radiological findings were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were followed up until February 26, 2020. Clinical features on admission were compared among those with different disease severity at the end of observation. Univariate analysis identified factors associated with symptom onset and disease progression. Findings: The median age was 68 years, and 54 patients were male. Briefly, 43, 41, and 20 patients on admission and 33, 43, and 28 patients at the end of observation had asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19, respectively. Serum lactate hydrogenase levels were significantly higher in 10 patients who were asymptomatic on admission but developed symptomatic COVID-19 compared with 33 patients who remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period. Older age, consolidation on chest computed tomography, and lymphopenia on admission were more frequent in patients with severe COVID-19 than those with mild COVID-19 at the end of observation. Interpretation: Lactate dehydrogenase level is a potential predictor of symptom onset in COVID-19. Older age, consolidation on chest CT images, and lymphopenia might be risk factors for disease progression of COVID-19 and contribute to the clinical management.
