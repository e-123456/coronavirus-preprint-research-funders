    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains from the index and early patients with COVID-19 in Dubai (United Arab Emirates; UAE) showed multiple spatiotemporal introductions from Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. We combine genetic, demographic, and clinical information from early patients to show that the majority of introductions were from Europe and the Middle East/Iran, and to provide evidence for early community-based transmission. We further catalogue new mutations in SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the UAE. Our findings can be used to further understand the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2.",
