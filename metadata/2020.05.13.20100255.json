    "abstract": "Critical inspection of the world data of COVID-19 mortality rates per population number has been made and used to express extensive variations in mortality over the globe in terms of a powered parameter \u03bb varying from 0 to 1.2 expressed as a measure of strength of primary infection, originating from China source. The copying process is degenerating successively while infection is passed on to secondary subjects. We have been able to correlate global data through this parameter; any value close to or less than 1 shows significant impact of diluted multiple secondary effect. Further, the scatter diagram shows no effect of temperature of the geographical location and so is likely as the virus is only being spread from either contact or close proximity; the virus does not need to face highs and lows of temperatures of the environment. It stays only in the range of human body temperature and appears to be stable in 36 to 40C range. If it faces the environmental temperatures it is possible for its quicker deactivation but that situation never arises for this virus except when it spreads from surfaces.",
