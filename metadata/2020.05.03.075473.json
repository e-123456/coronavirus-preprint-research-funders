    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the COVID-19, is spreading globally and has infected more than 3 million people. It has been discovered that SARS-CoV-2 initiates the entry into cells by binding to human angiotensin22 converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) through the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike glycoprotein. Hence, drugs that can interfere the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to hACE2 potentially can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 from entering human cells. Here, based on the N-terminal helix \u03b11 of human ACE2, we designed nine short peptides that have potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding. Molecular dynamics simulations of peptides in the their free and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-bound forms allow us to identify fragments that are stable in water and have strong binding affinity to the SARS28 CoV-2 spike proteins. The important interactions between peptides and RBD are highlighted to 29 provide guidance for the design of peptidomimetics against the SARS-CoV-2.",
