We demonstrate near-teravoxel volumetric images of optically-cleared lung tissue over cubic millimeter volumes with virtual H&E contrast and at submicron resolution. Our work builds on the prior autopsy case-series report from LSU-HSC, confirming and expanding novel findings of widespread pulmonary microangiopathy involving activation of mature megakaryocytes in the lung"

    "abstract": "The study of pulmonary samples from individuals who have died as a direct result of COVID19 infection is vital to our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. Histopathologic studies of lung tissue from autopsy of patients with COVID-19 specific mortality are only just emerging. All existing reports have relied on traditional 2-dimensional slide-based histological methods for specimen preparation. However, emerging methods for high-resolution, massively multiscale imaging of tissue microstructure using fluorescence labeling and tissue clearing methods enable the acquisition of tissue histology in 3-dimensions, that could open new insights into the nature of SARS-Cov-2 infection and COVID-19 disease processes. In this article, we present the first 3-dimensional images of lung autopsy tissues taken from a COVID-19 patient, including 3D \u201cvirtual histology\u201d of cubic-millimeter volumes of the diseased lung, providing unique insights into disease processes contributing to mortality that could inform frontline treatment decisions.",
