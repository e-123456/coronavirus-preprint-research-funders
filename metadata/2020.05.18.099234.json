    "abstract": "Spike, Envelope and Membrane proteins from the SARS CoV-2 virus surface coat are important vaccine targets. We hereby report recombinant co-expression of the three proteins (Spike, Envelope and Membrane) in a engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae platform (D-CryptTM) and their self-assembly as Virus-like particle (VLP). This design as a multi-antigenic VLP for SARS CoV-2 has the potential to be a scalable vaccine candidate. The VLP is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the SARS CoV-2, along with supportive HPLC, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and allied analytical data. The images clearly outline the presence of a \u201cCorona\u201d like morphology, and uniform size distribution.",
