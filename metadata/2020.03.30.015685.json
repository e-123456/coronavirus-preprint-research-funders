    "abstract": "Following the recent report of a furin-like cleavage site unique to SARS-CoV-2, we characterized additional amino acid residues, positioned within the crown of the spike (S) glycoprotein, under diversifying selection along the ancestral lineage of currently circulating pandemic strains, and affecting enhanced ability to infect host cells. Molecular dynamic simulations revealed longrange covariant movements of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein monomer in pre-fusion conformation with furin cleavage, and residue T333, under purifying selection, hinge of such movement.\nEvolutionary analysis revealed that the current human lineage likely emerged after a recombination event between ancestors in bat and pangolin. Recombination impacted residues",
