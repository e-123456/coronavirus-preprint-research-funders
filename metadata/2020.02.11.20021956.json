    "abstract": "Background: The emerging 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2212nCoV) has pushed several countries into state of emergency all over the world. The possible transmission of 2019\u2212nCoV by conjunctiva is controversial and has substantial public health implications. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was initiated to investigate the possible transmission of 2019\u2212nCoV through aerosol contact with conjunctiva. We enrolled 67 cases of confirmed or suspected cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) during 17\u221228 Jan 2020. Nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs were collected for real time RT-PCR analysis to detect 2019\u2212nCoV. Results: 63 patients were identified as laboratory\u2212confirmed NCP and the remaining four were suspected NCP. Conjunctival swab samples from one NCP patient yielded positive PCR results and two NCP patients yielded probable positive PCR results. None of the three patients had ocular symptoms. The only one NCP patient with conjunctivitis as the first symptom had negative conjunctival sac 2019\u2212nCoV test. Conjunctival swab samples from the four suspected cases of NCIP were negative. Conclusion: 2019\u2212nCoV can be detected in the conjunctival sac of patients with NCP. Through clinical analysis, viral transmission via the conjunctival route was not supported by the data. Good clinical protection can effectively cut off the transmission path.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
