    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) is mainly transmitted in the human population during close contact and respiratory droplets. It is currently unclear, however, whether CoV-2 is shed into milk and may also be transmitted from infected mothers to newborns trough breast feeding. Two recent reviews on the topic (1,2) did not find evidence for CoV-2 in human milk. However, the number of breast milk samples analyzed so far is small and samples were taken only once from each mother (2).",
