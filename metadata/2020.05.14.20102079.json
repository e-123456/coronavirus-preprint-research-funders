    "abstract": "Reports have emerged documenting earlier SARS-CoV-2 cases than previously recognized. To investigate this possibility in the Bay Area, we retrospectively tested 1,700 samples from symptomatic individuals for the last 2 months of 2019. No SARS-CoV-2 positive pools were identified, consistent with limited transmission in this population at this time.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
