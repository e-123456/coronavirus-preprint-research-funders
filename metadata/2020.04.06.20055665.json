    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a dramatic increase in demand on healthcare providers to provide respiratory support for patients with moderate to severe symptoms. In conjunction, the pandemic has challenged existing supply-chains to meet demands for medical equipment and resources. In response to these challenges, we report our work to repurpose two existing non-invasive ventilation (NIV) systems to provide solutions for the delivery of oxygen-enriched CPAP ventilation which are inherently resource and oxygen-efficient. We consider adaptation of CPAP systems typically used for sleep apnoea, together with a new Venturi-valve design which can be readily produced through 3D printing. Our aim in both cases was to support Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of \u226510cmH2O while achieving \u226540% FiO2. This supports a crucial part in the patient pathway for COVID-19 treatment, helping to provide early respiratory support prior to invasive ventilation options in the ICU.",
