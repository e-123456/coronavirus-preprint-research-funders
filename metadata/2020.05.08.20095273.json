    "abstract": "The analysis of COVID-19 statistics in different regions of the world with the intention of understanding the trend of progression of the pandemic is a task of paramount importance. Publicly available data includes cumulative number of cases, new cases each day, and the mortality. Extracting information from this data necessitates mathematical modeling. In this note a simple technique is adopted to determine the trend towards stabilized elimination of the infection. Results pertaining to several representative regions of the world are presented.",
