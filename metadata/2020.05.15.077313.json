Given this, a central database facilitating molecularlevel comparisons between published and patented anticoronavirus antibodies would be a valuable tool in the fight against COVID19. This resource would also act as a central hub to consolidate knowledge and coordinate efforts to identify novel antibodies that neutralise SARS-CoV-2. As the number of known binders builds up over time, researchers could harness this repository for many purposes, including deriving crucial sequence/structural patterns that distinguish neutralising from non-neutralising SARS-CoV-2 binders (1), or deducing independent neutralising epitopes exploitable by combination therapies. We have built CoV-AbDab, a new database that aims to document molecular information and metadata on all published or patented anti-coronavirus antibodies.",
