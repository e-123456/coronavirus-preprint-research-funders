    "abstract": "An exponential growth model was fitted to critical care admissions from multiple surveillance databases to determine likely COVID-19 case numbers and growth in the United Kingdom from 16 February \u2013 23 March 2020, after which a national lockdown occurred. We estimate that on 23 March, there were 102,000 (median; 95% credible interval 54,000 155,000) new cases and 320 (211 - 412) new critical care reports, with 464,000 (266,000 \u2013 628,000) cumulative cases since 16 February.
