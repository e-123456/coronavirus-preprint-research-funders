    "abstract": "The pandemic spread of novel coronavirus, (SARS-CoV-2) causing CoronaVirus Infectious Diseases (COVID-19) emerged into a global threat for human life causing serious death rates and economic crunch all over the globe. As on April 17, 2020 at 2:00am CEST, there include a total of 2,034,802 confirmed cases for Corona and 1,35,163 deaths worldwide have been reported which includes 212 countries, areas or territories reported by World Health Organization (WHO), in which USA tops 6,32,781 confirmed cases (28,221 deaths) followed by Italy 1,65,155 (21,647 deaths), Spain 1,77,633 (18,579 deaths) and China 84,149 (4,642 deaths). This study aims to compare the genomic nature of SARS-CoV-2 genome reported from Wuhan, China with two Indian isolate genome reported by ICMR-NIV, India. Further Phylogenetic studies performed with coronavirus infecting non-human species like Bats, Duck, and sparrow were compared with Indian and other country whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 using MegaX and traced out the association between the human coronavirus with the other species viral genome. In addition, epidemiological reports on COVID-19 among Worldwide and India centric data were compared between April 7, 2020 to April 17, 2020 global data and the number of active cases were increased dramatically in this 10 days period studied, highlighted in the current study.",
