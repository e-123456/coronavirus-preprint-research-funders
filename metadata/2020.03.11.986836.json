    "abstract": "The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 requires an urgent need to find effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19. We developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates\nEmail addresses: zhaodan2018@tsinghua.edu.cn (Dan Zhao), jszfc@vip.sina.com (Fengcai Zhu), steve.shen@convalife.com (Xiaokun Shen), zengjy321@tsinghua.edu.cn (Jianyang Zeng)",
