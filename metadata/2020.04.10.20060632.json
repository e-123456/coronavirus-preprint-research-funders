    "abstract": "In view of the shortage of current FFP-2 respirator masks, and therefore the lack of personal protective equipment for clinical staff, we aimed to explore ways of bottom-up solutions to allow hospitals to fabricate respirator masks that (i) fulfill FFP-2 criteria, (ii) are rapid and easy to produce to enable sufficient local production, and (iii) are constructed from materials that are routinely available in hospitals worldwide. In our investigation, particular surgical isolation and wrapping material fulfilled these criteria. With 3 layers of this material, a filter efficiency of 94% for 0.3 um particles, 99% for 0.5 um particles, and 100% for 3.0 um particles was obtained. After sterilization the filter efficiency allowed re-use as a FFP-1 respirator mask. This knowledge can contribute to global health, in any country and/or hospital that may not have access to otherwise commercial solutions.",
