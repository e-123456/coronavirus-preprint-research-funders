    "abstract": "The corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) or Covid-19 pandemic is growing alarmingly throughout the whole world. Using the power law scaling we analyze the data of different countries and three states of India up to 1st April, 2020 and explain in terms of power law exponent. We find significant reduction in growth of infections in China and Denmark (g reduced from approximately 2.18 to 0.05 and 11.41 to 6.95, respectively). Very slow reduction is also seen in Brazil and Germany (g reduced from approximately 6 to 4 and 11 to 7, respectively). Infection in India is growing (g=9.23) though lesser in number than that in the USA (highest g of 16 approximately, studied so far), Italy and a few other countries. Among three Indian states the growth in West Bengal (g=0.64) is much slower than other states like Maharashtra and Kerala (g=3.23 and 3.32, respectively). Some future predictions, though not rigid, has also been incorporated in our analysis. The earlier lock-down and stricter measures from the Governments concerned are being thought to be the only possible solutions, in the present situation, to fight against this virus.",
