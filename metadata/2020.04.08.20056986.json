    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a rapidly spreading global pathogen stressing the need for development of rapid testing protocols ever than before. The aim of present study was to develop a SARS-CoV-2 detection protocol which can be performed within minimal resources and timeframe. For this purpose, we implemented the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) methodology for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In order to improve the detection capability, the RT-LAMP assay was developed to simultaneously amplify two viral genes: ORF1a and N. A total of 45 SARS-CoV-2 associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases were enrolled. Viral RNA was extracted from the nasopharyngeal swab samples and analyzed simultaneously using PCR and RT-LAMP protocols. Overall, our SARS-CoV-2 dual gene RT-LAMP assay was found to be 95% accurate in detecting positive cases and showed no cross-reactivity or false-positive result in non-COVID-19 samples. Further evaluation on larger and multi-centric cohorts is currently underway to establish the diagnostic accuracy and subsequent implementation into clinical practice and at point-of-care settings.",
