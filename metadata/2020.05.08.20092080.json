    "abstract": "This study investigated self-policing COVID-19 and civic responsibilities in Lagos Metropolis, Nigeria adopting an online qualitative interview due to the current lockdown that denied field (face to face) interview. Fifty out of the feedbacks from the online interview were picked randomly to arrive at the conclusion of this study. The feedbacks suggested that there is adequate awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic among the people living in Lagos Metropolis, Nigeria and that they are following the directives of federal and state governments in an effort to reduce the community transmission of the infectious diseases. However, the ban on public gatherings and movements has made it impossible for many homes to meet their basic needs especially feeding. The government provided palliatives have also been largely insufficient to cater for the vulnerable. There could be a crisis (such as hunger) and the breakdown of law and order if the government does not increase their capacity to mitigate the hardship which the ongoing lockdown has imposed on the people.",
