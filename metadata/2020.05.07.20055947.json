    "abstract": "RNA extraction has become a bottleneck for detection of COVID-19, in part because of reagent shortages. We present here a rapid protocol that circumvents the need for RNA extraction that is compatible with RT-qPCR-based detection methods.\nFunding Statement\nWe would like to acknowledge support from the McGovern Institute; the Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Open Philanthropy Project; James and Patricia Poitras; and Robert Metcalfe.",
