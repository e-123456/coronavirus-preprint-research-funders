    "abstract": "A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China in the end of 2019, it causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia. It caused to the death rate of 4:63% among 571; 678 confirmed cases around the world to the March 28th, 2020. In this brief current study, we will present a simple mathematical model where we show how the probability of successfully getting infected when coming into contact with an infected individual and the per capita contact rate affect the healthy and infected population with time. The proposed model is used to offer predictions about the behavior of COVID-19 for a shorter period of time.",
