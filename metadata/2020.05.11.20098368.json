    "abstract": "With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid spread, concerns regarding its effects on pregnancy outcomes have been growing. We reviewed 164 pregnancies complicated by maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection across 20 studies. The most common clinical presentations were fever (57.9%), cough (35.4%), fatigue (15.2%), and dyspnea (12.2%). Only 2.4% of patients developed respiratory distress. Of all patients, 84.5% delivered via Cesarean section, with a 23.9% rate of maternal gestational complications, 20.3% rate of preterm delivery, and a concerning 2.3% rate of stillbirth delivery. Relative to known viral infections, the prognosis for pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 is good, even in the absence of specific antiviral treatment. However, neonates and acute patients, especially those with gestational or pre-existing co-morbidities, must be actively managed to prevent severe outcomes.",
