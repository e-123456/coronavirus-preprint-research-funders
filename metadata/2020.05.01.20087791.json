    "abstract": "Background: Health disparities were often overlooked during the emerging epidemic. Objectives: This study examined geographic differences in the rates of health care use and deaths among elderly patients. Methods: Based on individual patient records, multivariate Poisson and logistic models were used to calculate adjusted incidences of COVID-19 and probabilities of emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations and deaths. Results: Of 8,203 elderly patients, 11% died. Elderly people living in small metropolitan areas were half as likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19. Elderly female patients living in small metropolitan areas had much lower rates of ED visits (23% vs. 34%; Odds Ratio (OR): 0.58; 95%confidence interval (CI): 0.41-0.81; p=0.002) and hospitalizations (22% vs. 31%; OR: 0.62; 95%CI: 0.44 - 0.87; p=0.006) than those living in large metropolitan areas. Furthermore, those living in non-metropolitan areas were more likely to be hospitalized than those living in large metropolitan areas (44% vs. 33%; OR: 1.46; 95%CI: 1.07-1.99; p=0.016), especially among elderly men (51% vs. 35%; OR:1.86; 95%CI: 1.18-2.93; p=0.008). Finally, there was a significant linear trend in hospitalization rates among elderly male patients (p for trend = 0.01). Conclusions: Profound health disparities exist in the time of emerging epidemic.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
