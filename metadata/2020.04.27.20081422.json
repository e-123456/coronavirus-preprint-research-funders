    "abstract": "India has experienced an early and harshest lockdown from 25th March 2020 in response to the outbreak. However, an accurate estimation of the progression of the spread of infection and the level of preparedness to combat this disease are urgently needed. Using a data-based mathematical model, our study has made predictions on the number of cases that are expected to rise in India till 14th June 2020. The epidemiological data of daily cases have been utilized from 25th March (i.e., the first day of lockdown) to 23rd April 2020. In the study, we have stimulated two possible scenarios (optimistic and pessimistic) for the prediction. As per the optimistic approach of modelling, COVID-19 may end in the first week of June 2020 with a total of 77,900 infected cases including 2,442 fatalities. However, the results under the pessimistic scenario are a bit scary as it shows that a total of 283,300 infected cases with 10,180 fatalities till 14th June. To win the battle, 10 weeks of complete lockdown is much needed at least in the infected states and the union territories of India. Alternatively, the isolation of clusters (hotspot regions) is required if India wants a resume of some essential activities.",
