    "abstract": "2 The outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus (2019-nCov) represents a pandemic threat that has been 3 declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a 4 key target for urgently needed vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate 5 medical countermeasure (MCM) development we determined a 3.5 \u00c5-resolution cryo-EM 6 structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the 7 trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible 8 conformation. We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds 9 ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Additionally we tested several published SARS10 CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to nCoV-2019 S, suggesting antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two virus RBDs. The atomic-resolution structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable rapid development and evaluation of MCMs to address the ongoing public health crisis.",
