    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is based on RT-qPCR protocols that limited testing to facilities with Real Time PCR devices and probes supply. Here we described and adapted version of the RT-qPCR CDC protocol where N1, N2 and N3 primers are used for end point PCR and amplicons are visualized on agarose gel with a limit of detection up to 20 viral RNA copies/uL. This protocol would allow to extend SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis to basic molecular biology laboratories with a great impact on surveillance programs at developing countries.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
