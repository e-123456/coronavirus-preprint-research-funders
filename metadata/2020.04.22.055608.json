    "abstract": "The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic within a few months of onset motivates the development of a rapidly scalable vaccine. Here, we present a self-amplifying RNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein encapsulated within a lipid nanoparticle as a vaccine and demonstrate induction of robust neutralization of a pseudo-virus, proportional to quantity of specific IgG and of higher quantities than recovered COVID-19 patients. These data provide insight into the vaccine design and evaluation of immunogenicity to enable rapid translation to the clinic.\nMAIN The unprecedented and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic, with the current estimated number of confirmed cases >2.2 million people,1 has motivated the need for a rapidly producible and scalable vaccine. Coronaviruses are positive-sense, single stranded RNA viruses that cause disease pathology ranging from the common cold to pneumonia.2,3 Despite being listed on the WHO blueprint priority list, there are currently no licensed vaccines for SARS or MERS.4 However, previous studies have elucidated the need to stabilize coronavirus spike proteins in their pre-fusion conformation in order to serve as a vaccine immunogen.5",
