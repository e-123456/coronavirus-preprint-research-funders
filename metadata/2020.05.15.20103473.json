    "abstract": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently a global pandemic, and the early screening of COVID-19 is one of the key factors for COVID-19 control and treatment. Here, we developed and validated chest CT-based imaging biomarkers for COVID-19 patient screening. We identified the vasculature-like signals from CT images and found that, compared to healthy and community acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, the COVID-19 patients revealed significantly higher abundance of these signals. Furthermore, unsupervised feature learning leads to the discovery of clinical-relevant imaging biomarkers from the vasculature-like signals for accurate and sensitive COVID-19 screening that has been double-blindly validated in an independent hospital (sensitivity: 0.941, specificity: 0.904, AUC: 0.952). Our findings could open a new avenue to assist screening of COVID-19 patients.",
