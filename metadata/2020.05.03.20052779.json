    "abstract": "This paper attempts to provide methods to estimate the real scenario of the novel coronavirus pandemic crisis on Brazil and the states of Distrito Federal, Sao Paulo, Pernambuco, Espirito Santo, Amazonas and Distrito Federal. By the use of a SEIRD mathematical model with age division, we predict the infection and death curve, stating the peak date for Brazil and these states. We also carry out a prediction for the ICU demand on these states for a visualization of the size of a possible collapse on the local health system. By the end, we establish some future scenarios including the stopping of social isolation and the introduction of vaccines and efficient medicine against the virus.",
