    "abstract": "Background \u2212 The Covid\u221219 pandemic imposed the most devastating challenge on healthcare systems worldwide. Iran was among the first countries that had to confront serious shortages in RT\u2212PCR testing for SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 and ventilators availabilities throughout the COVID\u221219 outbreak. This study aimed to investigate the clinical course of hospitalized COVID\u221219 patients with different rRT\u2212PCR test results during the first 3 weeks of the outbreak in Qazvin province, Iran. Methods \u2212For this retrospective cohort study, data of hospitalized patients primarily diagnosed as having COVID\u221219 in all 12 centers across the whole Qazvin province during Feb 20\u2212Mar 11, 2020 was analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression model was applied to assess the independent associates of death among COVID\u221219 patients. Results \u2212 998 patients (57% male, median age 54 years) with positive chest CT\u2212scan changes were included in this study. Among them, 558 patients were examined with rRT\u2212PCR test and 73.8% tested positive. Case fatality rate was 20.68% and 7.53% among test\u2212positive and test negative hospitalized patients, respectively. While only 5.2% of patients were ICU admitted, case fatality rates outside ICU were 17.70% and 4.65% in test-positive and test-negative non\u2212ICU admitted patients, correspondingly. The independent associates of death were age \u2265 70 years, testing positive with rRT\u2212PCR test, having immunodeficiency disorders and ICU admission. Conclusions \u2212 Hospitalized COVID\u221219 patients with mild symptoms despite positive chest CT changes and major comorbidities were more probable to have negative rRT\u2212PCR test result, hence lower case fatality rate and a more favorable outcome.",
