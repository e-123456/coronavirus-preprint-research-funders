    "abstract": "Human coronaviruses are known for their tropism for central nervous system and to be associated with neurological complications. SARS-CoV-2 pandemy represent a major health issue and if respiratory symptoms are at the forefront, neurological symptoms should be expected. Here we report the case of two patient that developed encephalitic symptoms with neuropsychological impairment and pathologic cerebrospinal fluid features concomitantly to SARS-CoV-2 documented infection. Both patient recovered promptly without treatment. This report raises the question of central nervous system involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the need for investigation of neuropsychological complications in infected patient.",
