    "abstract": "(69 words) 47 The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demands rapid identification of immunogenic targets for the design of efficient vaccines and serological detection tools. In this report, using pools of overlapping linear peptides and functional assays, we present two immunodominant regions on the spike glycoprotein that were highly recognized by neutralizing antibodies in the sera of COVID-19 convalescent patients. One is highly specific to SARS-CoV-2, and the other is a potential pan-coronavirus target.",
