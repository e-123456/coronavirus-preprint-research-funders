    "abstract": "Background: Despite efforts to initially contain Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), it has spread worldwide and has strained international healthcare systems to the point where advanced respiratory resources and ventilators are depleted. This study aims to explore splitting ventilators, or multi-ventilation, as a viable alternative in these demanding times. We investigated whether individualized tidal volume and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) delivery is possible to lungs of different compliances that are being simultaneously ventilated from one anesthesia ventilator. Methods: We performed a controlled experiment in an operating room environment without animal or human participants. Two test lungs were connected to distinct modified Y-pieces that were ventilated in parallel from a single anesthesia ventilator. Results: Ventilation can be manipulated to qualitatively deliver individually tailored tidal volumes in the setting of varying PEEP and compliance requirements in pressure control mode. Conclusions: Splitting ventilators, or multi-ventilation, is a viable alternative to acute ventilator shortage during a pandemic. Ventilators can be split for individualized tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure delivery in multiple subjects of differing compliances and demographics.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
