    "abstract": "Drug repositioning represents an effective way to control the current COVID-19 pandemic. Previously, we identified 24 FDA-approved drugs which exhibited substantial antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells. Since antiviral efficacy could be altered in different cell lines, we developed an antiviral screening assay with human lung cells, which is more appropriate than Vero cell. Comparative analysis of antiviral activities revealed that nafamostat is the most potent drug in human lung cells (IC50 = 0.0022\u03bcM).",
