        "Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019; this patient experienced severe respiratory syndrome. The authors identified a new RNA virus strain belonging to the family Coronaviridae that was subsequently designated as \u2018WH-Hum 1 coronavirus\u2019 (and also \u20182019-nCoV\u2019). According to Coutard et al. (2020) the nearest bat precursor would be RaTG13 with a genome identity to SARS-CoV-2 of 98%. Phylogenetic studies supported the theory of a natural origin for SARSCoV-2 (Andersen et al. 2020)",
        "The China National Center for Bioinformation keeps an updated resource on COVID -19 (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/tool/annotation; (Zhao et al. 2020) and provides different analytical tools to study SARS-CoV-2 variation. The open-source project Nextstrain (https://nextstrain.org; (Hadfield et al. 2018) provides an interactive web portal that allows navigating SARS-CoV-2 genome variation and helps track the spread of disease outbreaks"

    "abstract": "The human pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) is responsible for the major pandemic of the 21st century. We analyzed >4,700 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and associated meta-data retrieved from public repositories. SARS-CoV-2 sequences have a high sequence identity (>99.9%), which drops to >96% when compared to bat coronavirus. We built a mutationannotated reference SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny with two main macro-haplogroups, A and B, both of Asian origin, and >160 sub-branches representing virus strains of variable geographical origins worldwide, revealing a uniform mutation occurrence along branches that could complicate the design of future vaccines. The root of SARS-CoV-2 genomes locates at the Chinese haplogroup B1, with a TMRCA dating to 12 November 2019 - thus matching epidemiological records. Sub-haplogroup A2a originates in China and represents the major non-Asian outbreak. Multiple bottleneck episodes, most likely associated with superspreader hosts, explain COVID-19 pandemic to a large extent.

        "It is remarkable that a few haplotypes are disproportionally represented in continental regions or in particular countries (Supplementary Material; Figure S10), appearing abruptly in a few days\u2019 period. This pattern is compatible with super-spreaders arriving to certain geographic locations and giving rise to severe founder effects (Figure 3A). Haplotypes #H1, #H2, #H3, and #H4 (ID\u2019s as in Table S8) are the most frequently repeated ones. H1 (n = 163; haplogroup A2a4), represents one of the main haplotypes responsible for the introduction or the pandemic in Europe (104/163; 63.80%), with particular frequency in the UK (35/163; 21.47%) and Belgium (23/163; 14.11%); it is also prevalent in North America (with a one week delay; 15/163 13.50%), and Australia (18/163; 11.04%). H2 (n = 133; A2a2a) occurs also in Europe at high frequency (75/133; 56.39%; 34 times in Iceland) and in North America (48/133; 35.82%; mostly in USA with 45 occurrences). H3 (n = 132; B1a1) appears at remarkably high frequency and almost exclusively in USA (126/132; 95.45%; B1a1). H4 (n = 78; A) corresponds to the reference sequence (GenBank acc. no MN908947.3) and it reaches the highest frequency in Asia (60/78; 76.92%), particularly in China (49/78; 62.82%); the frequency of H4 increased in two pulses, one coinciding with its first appearance in China at the end of December 2019, and the next coinciding with the large Asian outbreak in mid-February 2020; later, H4 moved to other non-Asian locations, e.g. USA (10/78; 12.82%).",
