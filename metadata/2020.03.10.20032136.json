    "abstract": "Background: Adolescents and young adults might play a key role in the worldwide spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), because they are more involved in overseas studying, business, working, and travelling. However, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of them are still unknown. Methods: We collected data of 46 confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 10 to 35 years from the study hospital. The demographics, epidemiological, and clinical data were collected. Several key epidemiological parameters, the asymptomatic cases and transmission to their family members and the clinical characteristics at admission, and during treatment were summarized. RESULTS: Of 46 confirmed patients, 14 patients (47.3%) were aged from 10 to 24 years, and 24 (52.7%) patients were male. The mean incubation period for symptomatic cases was 6.6 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4 - 9.6). The median serial interval was 1.9 days (95% CI 0.4 - 6.2). Three of asymptomatic cases showed the transmission to their family members. Only 1 patient was identified as severe cases at admission. The common symptoms at admission were dry cough (34, 91.0%), and fever (29, 69.0%). Nearly 60% of the patients had showed ground-glass opacity by chest CT findings. Three patients developed acute kidney injury during treatment. Majority of patients (78.3%) were discharged by the end of the follow-up. Conclusions: The adolescent and young adult patients of COVID-19 had a long incubation period, and a short serial interval. The transmission to their family contactors occurred in asymptomatic cases. Few of the study patients have developed complications during treatment.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
