    "abstract": "The Covid-19 first occurs in Wuhan, China in December 2019. After that the virus spread all around the world and at the time of writing this paper the total number of confirmed cases are above 4.7 million with over 315000 deaths. Machine learning algorithms built on radiography images can be used as decision support mechanism to aid radiologists to speed up the diagnostic process. The aim of this work is twofold. First, a quantitative analysis to evaluate 12 off-the-shelf convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the purpose of COVID-19 X-ray image analysis. Specifically, CNN transfer learning procedure was adopted due to the small number of images available for investigation. We also proposed a simple CNN architecture with a small number of parameters that perform well on distinguishing COVID-19 from normal X-rays. Secondly, a qualitative investigation performed to inspect the decisions made by CNNs using a technique known as class activation maps (CAM). Using CAMs, one can map the activations contributed most to the decision of CNNs back to the original image to visualize the most discriminating regions on the input image. Chest X-ray images used in this work are coming from 3 publicly available sources. Two COVID-19 X-ray image datasets and a large dataset of other non-COVID-19 viral infections, bacterial infections and normal X-rays utilised. We conclude that CNN decisions should not be taken into consideration, despite their high classification accuracy, until clinicians can visually inspect the region(s) of the input image used by CNNs that lead to its prediction.",
