    "abstract": "Objectives. To assess knowledge, attitudes, anxiety and behavioral adaptations to COVID-19. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among non-healthcare-related participants after a stringent stay-at-home directive was implemented. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with anxiety, perceived seriousness of COVID-19 and loneliness. Results. A total of 464 participants responded to the survey. Most participants recognized cough, shortness of breath and fever as primary symptoms of COVID-19. Nearly 50% reported high levels of anxiety to COVID-19 and 48% reported being loneliness during the social isolation. Those with higher level of COVID-19 knowledge had 1.20 times higher levels with anxiety. Being married had 1.79 times higher levels of anxiety about COVID-19. Older age was associated with loneliness during the social isolation. Older age was also associated with taking the pandemic seriously. Females were less likely to report loneliness than males. Conclusions. It is crucial for the public health authorities not only provide accurate and scientific information about the COVID-19 promoting protective behavior changes but also to minimize anxiety through supportive messages and recommendations for positive coping strategies and timely offering of counseling services for those in need.",
