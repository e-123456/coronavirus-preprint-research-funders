    "abstract": "Though ideal for determining the burden of disease, SARS-CoV2 test shortages preclude its implementation as a robust surveillance system in the US. We correlated the use of the derivative influenza-negative influenza-like illness (fnILI) z-score from the CDC as a proxy for incident cases and disease-specific deaths. For every unit increase of fnILI z-score, the number of cases increased by 70.2 (95%CI[5.1,135.3]) and number of deaths increased by 2.1 (95%CI[1.0,3.2]). FnILI data may serve as an accurate outcome measurement to track the spread of the and allow for informed and timely decision-making on public health interventions.",
