    "abstract": "A major open question, affecting the policy makers decisions, is the estimation of the true size of COVID-19 infections. Most of them are undetected, because of a large number of asymptomatic cases. We provide an efficient, easy to compute and robust lower bound estimator for the number of undetected cases. A \"modified\" version of the Chao estimator is proposed, based on the cumulative time-series distribution of cases and deaths. Heterogeneity has been accounted for by assuming a geometrical distribution underlying the data generation process. An (approximated) analytical variance formula has been properly derived to compute reliable confidence intervals at 95%. An application to Austrian situation is provided and results from other European Countries are mentioned in the discussion.",
