    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense single stranded RNA virus with high human transmissibility. This study generated Whole Genome data to determine the origin and pattern of transmission of SARSCoV-2 from the first six cases tested in The Gambia. Total RNA from SARS-CoV-2 was extracted from inactivated nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs of six cases and converted to cDNA following the ARTIC COVID-19 sequencing protocol. Libraries were constructed with the NEBNext ultra II DNA library prep kit for Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Ligation sequencing kit and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq and Nanopore GridION, respectively. Sequencing reads were mapped to the Wuhan reference",
