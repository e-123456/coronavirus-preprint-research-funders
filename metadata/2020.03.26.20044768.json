    "abstract": "Background: COVID-19 has been widely spreading. We aim to examine adaptive immune cells in non-severe patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 shedding. Methods 37 non-severe patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence transferred to Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively recruited to PP (persistently positive) group, which was further allocated to PPP group (n=19) and PPN group (n=18), according to their testing results after 7 days (N=negative). Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Data from age- and sex-matched non-severe patients at disease onset (PA [positive on admission] patients, n=37), and lymphocyte subpopulation measurements from matched 54 healthy subjects were extracted for comparison. Results Compared with PA patients, PP patients had much improved laboratory findings, including WBCs, neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, albumin, AST, CRP, SAA, and IL-6. The absolute numbers of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and NK cells were significantly higher in PP group than that in PA group, and were comparable to that in healthy controls. PPP subgroup had markedly reduced B cells and T cells compared to PPN group and healthy subjects. Finally, paired results of these lymphocyte subpopulations from 10 PPN patients demonstrated that the number of T cells and B cells significantly increased when the SARS-CoV-2 tests turned negative. Conclusion Persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence in non-severe COVID-19 patients is associated with reduced numbers of adaptive immune cells. Monitoring lymphocyte subpopulations could be clinically meaningful in identifying fully recovered COVID-19 patients.
