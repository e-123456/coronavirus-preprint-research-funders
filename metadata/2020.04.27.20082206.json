    "abstract": "The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 triggers severe pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in severe cases. According to WHO reported, Egypt is among the countries with low confirmed SARS CoV2 infected symptomatic cases and death. We postulate that one of the reasons for this may be due mutations in the viral receptor. Therefore this study was conducted to confirm or reject this postulation.",
