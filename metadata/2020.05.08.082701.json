    "abstract": "The coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, is presently responsible for a global pandemic wherein more than 3.5 million people have been infected and more than 250,000 killed to-date. There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, leaving governments and public health agencies with little defense against the virus aside from advising or enforcing best practices for virus transmission prevention, which include hand-washing, physical distancing, use of face covers, and use of effective disinfectants. In this study, a novel iodine complex called CupriDyne\u00ae was assessed for its ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. CupriDyne was shown to be effective in inactivating the virus in a timedependent manner, reducing virus titers by 99% (2 logs) after 30 minutes, and reducing virus titers to below the detection limit after 60 minutes. The novel iodine complex tested herein offers a safe and gentle alternative to conventional disinfectants for use on indoor and outdoor surfaces.",
