    "abstract": "Healthcare workers are at increased risk of exposure to COVID-19. The majority of cases are acquired through inhalation of infected respiratory particles, contamination with infected surfaces or whilst performing aerosol-generating procedures. Basic infection prevention measures are essential to protect healthcare workers from contracting the disease when managing patients; consequently global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) has exceeded supply in many regions. We present a novel, innovative polycarbonate shield designed for ENT clinicians performing tracheostomies. Clinical investigations using the shield demonstrated a sixteen-fold decrease in the number of particles detected at the position of the operating surgeon when the shield was used (particle size 0.3\u03bcm; with shield 27,000 versus 439,000 without shield). The shield, used with appropriate PPE, could therefore help to minimise exposure to aerosol generated particles such as during tracheostomies on patients with COVID-19.",
