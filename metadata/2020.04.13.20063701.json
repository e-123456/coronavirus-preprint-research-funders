    "abstract": "The simplest approximation for the first stages of the infection spread is considered. The specific feature of the COVID-19 characterized by its long latent period is taken into account. Exponential increase of numbers of infected people is determined by the half period of the maximal latent time for the COVID-19. The averaging over latent period leads to additional increase of the infected numbers.",
