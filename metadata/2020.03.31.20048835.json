    "abstract": "I employ a simple mathematical model of an epidemic process to evaluate how three basic quantities: the reproduction number (R), the numbers of sensitive (S) and infectious (I) individuals, and total community size (N) affect strategies to control COVID-19. Numerical simulations show that strict suppression measures at the beginning of an epidemic can create low infectious numbers, which thereafter can be managed by mitigation measures over longer periods to flatten the epidemic curve. The stronger the suppression measure, the faster it achieves the low numbers of infections that are conducive to subsequent management. Our results on short-term strategies point to either a two-step control strategy, following failed mitigation, that begins with suppression of the reproduction number, RC, below 1.0, followed by renewed mitigation measures that manage the epidemic by maintaining Rc at approximately 1.0, or should suppression not be feasible, a progressive lowering of the effective reproductive number RCeff\u2248Rc S/N below 1.0. The objectives of the full sequence of measures observed in a number of countries, and likely to see in the longer term, can be symbolically represented as: R0 \u2192 RC0 \u2192 RC<<1.0 \u2192 RC\u22481.0 \u2192 RCeff<1.0. We discuss the predictions of this analysis and how it fits into longer-term sequences of measures, including using the herd immunity concept to \u2032leverage\u2032 immunity.",
