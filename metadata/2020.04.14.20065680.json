    "abstract": "Background: The ongoing worldwide epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed a huge threat to global public health. However, with regard to the effects of inflammatory markers on the severity of COVID-19, studies have reported associations that vary in strength and direction. Aims: In the meta-analysis, we aimed to provide an overview of the association of inflammatory markers with severity of COVID-19. Methods: The following databases were searched: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang database and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) database until March 20, 2020. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random or fixed-effects models. Results: A total of 16 studies were included in our analysis comprising of 3962 patients with COVID-19. Random-effects results demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 in non-severe group had lower levels for CRP (WMD = -41.78 mg/l, 95% CI = [-52.43, -31.13], P\nCompeting Interest Statement",
