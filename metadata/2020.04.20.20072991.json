    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing public health emergency and economic crisis all over the globe. Being widely spread, the virus can make any place in the world a new epicenter of the possible second wave of outbreaks. To control the pandemic progression, monitoring of the virus spreading is imperative. This paper proposes a simple and robust approach to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic progression in many countries or regions. This data science pipeline can provide actionable insights via straightforward COVID-19 data visualization for many regions at a glance, which informs of relative time delay of the pandemic progression, projected numbers of confirmed cases in the near future, and the sizes of infections.",
