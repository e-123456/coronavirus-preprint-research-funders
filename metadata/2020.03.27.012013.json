    "abstract": "The effect of the rapid accumulation of non-synonymous mutations on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known. To predict the impact of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions identified in ORF3a on the formation of B-cell epitopes and their role in evading the immune response, nucleotide and protein sequences of 537 available SARS-CoV-2 genomes were analyzed for the presence of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions.",
