    "abstract": "We use a data quality model to demonstrate that BCG vaccination is correlated with protection from death from COVID19. From a mechanistic perspective, BCG is well described to elicit its protective non-specific effects through the process of trained immunity. Therapeutically enhancing trained immunity may therefore be an important mechanism in protection from the lethal effects of COVID19\nCompeting Interest Statement",
