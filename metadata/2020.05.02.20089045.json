    "abstract": "The recent surge in COVID-19 cases has exposed health care workers (HCWs) to a wide range of psychological stressors and predisposed them to anxiety-related disorders. Here, we investigated the anxiety level in this population. This multi-center, cross-sectional study was performed on 1038 HCWs in 14 hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Beck anxiety inventory (BAI) was used to measure the level of anxiety in this population. In all, 1038 hospital staffs with a mean age of 36.30+/-8.23 years old participated in this study. Most participants were 31 to 40 years old (43.2), female (87.6%), and nurses (49.5%). The BAI scores for the participants were in a positive skew distribution, with a score range of 0-63, a median of 12 and a mean value of 15.30+/-11.43. Of the 1038 hospital staff, 411 (39.6%) had moderate to severe anxiety. The anxiety level was significantly higher in health care workers \u226440 years old, women, and nurses. Gender, age, and working positions had the most relation with anxiety, respectively. It seems that HCWs experienced a high level of anxiety in the COVID-19 outbreak. One of the important measures in each epidemic is doing supportive care to maintain the mental well-being of HCWs, especially in higher risk groups, including younger HCWs, women, and nurses.",
