    "abstract": "Specific elements of viral genomes regulate interactions within host cells. Here, we calculated the secondary structure content of >2500 coronaviruses and computed >100000 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We found that the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 are the most structured elements in the viral genome and the 5\u2019 has the strongest propensity to associate with human proteins. The domain encompassing nucleotides 23000 \u2013 24000 is highly conserved both at the sequence and structural level, while the region upstream varies significantly. These two sequences code for a domain of the viral protein Spike S that interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and has the potential to bind sialic acids. Our predictions indicate that the first 1000 nucleotides in the 5\u2019 can interact with proteins",
