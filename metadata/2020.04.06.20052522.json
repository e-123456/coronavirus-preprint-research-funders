    "abstract": "There is scarce information on the frequency of co-detection of respiratory pathogens (RP) in patients with Covid-19. Documentation of coinfections in Covid-19 pneumonia patients may be relevant for appropriate clinical and therapeutic management of patients. Between March 4th and March 28th, 2020, a total of 183 adult patients testing positive by SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR on respiratory specimens were hospitalized with interstitial pneumonia at our center, of whom 103 were tested for other RP by a multiplexed PCR assay. Three patients had a positive result for either one (n=2; Coronavirus HKU1 or Mycoplasma pneumoniae) or two targets (n=1; Influenza virus A (H3) and Respiratory syncytial virus B). Twenty-three patients testing negative by SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR and presentig with clinical, laboratory findings and imaging compatibe with Covid-19 pneumonia underwent RP screening. Of these, 6 (26%) had a positive result for a single RP. Our data indicate that despite the apparent rarity of coinfections in patients with Covid-19 pneumonia, routine testing for RP should be advised, since agents for which specific therapy can be prescribed may be detected.",
