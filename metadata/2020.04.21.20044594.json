    "abstract": "There is an exponential growth of COVID-19. The adaptation of preventive measures to limit the spread of infection among the people is the best solution to this health issue. The identification of infected cases and their isolation from healthy people is one of the most important preventive measures. In this regard, screening of the samples from a large number of people is needed which requires a lot of reagent kits for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The use of smart pooled sample testing with the help of algorithms may be a quite useful strategy in the current prevailing scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the help of this strategy, the optimum number of samples to be pooled for a single test may be determined based on the total positivity rate of the particular community.",
