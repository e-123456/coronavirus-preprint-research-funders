    "abstract": "There is a pressing urgency to understand the entry route of SARS-CoV-2 viruses into the human body. SARS-CoV-2 viruses enter through ACE2 receptors after the S proteins of the virus are primed by proteases such as TMPRSS2. Most studies focused on the airway epithelial and lung alveolar cells as the route of infection, while the mode of transmission through the ocular route is not well established. Here, we profiled the presence of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and receptor-associated enzymes at single-cell resolution of thirty-three human ocular cell types. We identified unique populations of corneal cells with high ACE2 expression, among which the conjunctival cells co-expressed both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, suggesting that they could serve as the entry points for the virus. Integrative analysis further models the signaling and transcription regulon networks involved in the infection of distinct corneal cells. Our work constitutes a unique resource for the development of new treatments and management of COVID-19.",
