Our mathematical techniques makes it possible to calculate the rate of growth of the cases efficiently, and provides a good understanding of future trends in Italy and USA. The evolution of the real time data makes it possible to analyse the suitability of steps taken to eradicate the pandemic by the countries. We compare the day to day development of the coronavirus cases in Italy and USA, that keeping in view the population pyramid and the population density, leads us to understand possible difference in the number of effected population.",
