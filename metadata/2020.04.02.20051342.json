    "abstract": "A mathematical model is developed to study the spread of the COVID-19 epidemics in France. Data from French Public Agency of Health are considered to calibrate the model. The spread of the epidemics strongly depends on confinement measures. The aim of the paper is to predict the evolution of the epidemics under various scenarios that could be taken to quit confinement. The spread of the disease and its re-emergence strongly depends on these scenarios.",
