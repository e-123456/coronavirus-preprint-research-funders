    "abstract": "Objective: To optimize clinical laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 from suspect cases by Likelihood Ratio of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody. Methods: By reinterpreting the data in the article \"Diagnostic Value of Combined Detection of Serum 2019 novel coronavirus IgM and IgG Antibodies in novel coronavirusin Infection\", the positive likelihood ratio of IgM and IgG antibody in diagnosis of COVID-19 (nucleic acid positive patients) was calculated, and the posterior probability of IgM and IgG antibodies and their tandem detection to diagnose was finally calculated. Results: The positive likelihood ratios of single IgM and IgG antibody were 18.50 and 12.65 respectively, and the posterior probabilities were 90.18% and 86.26% respectively. However, the posterior probability of the two antibodies tandem detection is 99.15%, which can give clinicians quantitative confidence in the diagnosis of COVID-19 from suspected cases. According to the results of this study, combining the advantages and disadvantages of nucleic acid detection and antibody detection, the clinical pathway for clinicians to diagnose COVID-19 is found. Conclusion: For suspected cases, IgM and IgG antibody tests should be firstly done at the same time. If the antibody tests are all positive, COVID-19 can be confirmed. If not, nucleic acid detection (one or more times) is performed, and in extreme cases, high-throughput viral genome sequencing is performed.",
