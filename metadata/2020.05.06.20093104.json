    "abstract": "Populations are locked down during an epidemic to slow down the rate of infection so that epidemic trajectory is flattened. This helps to keep cases at a manageable level. Given the enormous economic damage and misery caused by a lockdown, it is imperative to keep the lockdown period limited . A lockdown is useful only if it can be ensured that after the lockdown is lifted, the epidemic trajectory does not rise sharply again. We present here the results from a mathematical model of the epidemic which examines how the timing, strength and duration of the lockdown affects the post-lockdown epidemic trajectory.
