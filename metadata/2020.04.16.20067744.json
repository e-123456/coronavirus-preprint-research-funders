    "abstract": "Individuals who live with mental disorders may be particularly vulnerable to the psychological stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, based on screening of 11,072 clinical notes containing a COVID-19 related word (corona, COVID, virus, epidemic, pandemic, and contaminate/contamination), we report data on 918 adult patients from a psychiatric treatment setting in Denmark that display psychiatric symptoms (especially anxiety), which appear to be related to the pandemic and/or its consequential societal changes. This finding underlines the necessity of taking urgent action to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with mental disorders.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
