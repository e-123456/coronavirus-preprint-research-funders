    "abstract": "Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global health problem. We aim to investigate the changes in the results of viral nucleic acid tests on pharyngeal swabs and feces of patients with COVID-19 and CT imaging of lungs as the disease progresses. Methods: Seven patients with COVID-19 in the third affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University Yuedong Hospital were retrospectively enrolled with clinical features, including imaging staging, and performance characteristics of viral nucleic acid test results of pharyngeal swabs and feces. The dynamic changes of these features were observed during hospitalization, and therapeutic effect and prognosis of patients were evaluated. Results: The results of seven confirmed cases were positive for viral nucleic acid tests on pharyngeal swabs early after the onset of symptoms, and then turned negative; while the results of viral nucleic acid tests on feces were persistently positive in the mid-term clinical treatment and recovery period. And the viral nucleic acid test results were capricious in three cases. Pulmonary CT imaging showed characteristic changes in early, advanced and recovery phases. Conclusion: The application of viral nucleic acid detection and pulmonary CT imaging can be used for screeningof suspected cases, and early diagnosis and dynamic condition assessment of patients.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
