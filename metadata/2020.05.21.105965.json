    "abstract": "The dynamics and thermodynamics of the homodimer main protease protein SARS-CoV-2 are 2 analysed at the level of Elastic Network Models (ENM). Correlated motions display a rich and 3 heterogeneous dynamical structure, including allosterically correlated motions between the 4 active sites in the two domains. Exhaustive 1-point and 2-point mutation maps, and their effect 5 on binding free energies and allosteric free energies confirm the susceptibility identified in 6 recent candidate inhibitor assays, but also suggest several new candidate regions for control 7 and inhibition of the protease function, which may assist the development of current fragment 8 binding screens.",
