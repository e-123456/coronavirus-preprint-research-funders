    "abstract": "Since January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has been escalating from North America to Asia. Various studies projected the spread of pandemic globally, using air passenger data from an infected area. But there could be various parameters that can be the basis for the forecasting of the pandemic. Current research adopts the Medical GIS approach and incorporates critical parameters from various domains to create a global alertness scale to combat the pandemic. The finding of the study ranks the countries on a 1 to 9 scale based on the spatial alertness In this context, the study focuses on the role of GIS techniques as an enabler to fight against the global pandemic and could be beneficial for the authorities to adopt timely preventive actions.",
