    "abstract": "Background. The extent of spread of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the UK and elsewhere is unknown because typically only symptomatic individuals are diagnosed. We 45 performed a serological study of recent blood donors in Scotland to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection.\nMethods. A pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study group comprised samples from 1000 50 blood donors collected in Scotland during March, 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019.",
