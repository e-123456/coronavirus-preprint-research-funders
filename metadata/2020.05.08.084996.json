    "abstract": "The site of SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication critically impacts strategies for COVID-19 diagnosis, transmission mitigation, and treatment. We determined the cellular location of the SARS-CoV-2 target receptor protein, ACE2, in the human upper airway, finding striking enrichment (200-700 folds) in the olfactory neuroepithelium relative to nasal respiratory or tracheal epithelial cells. This cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 may underlie its high transmissibility and association with olfactory dysfunction, while suggesting a viral reservoir potentially amenable to intranasal therapy.",
