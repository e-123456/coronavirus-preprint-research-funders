    "abstract": "Background: As the number of suspected and confirmed COVID19 cases in the US continues to rise, the US surgeon general, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and several specialty societies have issued recommendations to consider canceling elective surgeries. However, these recommendations have also faced controversy and opposition. Methods: Using previously published information and publicly available data on COVID19 infections, we calculated a transmission rate and generated a mathematical model to predict a lower bound for the number of healthcare-acquired COVID19 infections that could be prevented by canceling or postponing elective outpatient surgeries in Washington state. Results: Our model predicts that over the course of 30 days, at least 75.9 preventable patient infections and at least 69.3 preventable healthcare worker (HCW) infections would occur in WA state alone if elective outpatient procedures were to continue as usual. Conclusion: Canceling elective outpatient surgeries during the COVID19 pandemic could prevent a large number of patient and healthcare worker infections.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
