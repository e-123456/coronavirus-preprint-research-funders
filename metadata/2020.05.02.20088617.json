    "abstract": "Since the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) in the 2nd day of March, Saudi Arabia has not report a quite rapid COVD-19 spread compared to America and many European countries. Possible causes include the spread of asymptomatic cases. To characterize the transmission of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, this paper applies a susceptible, exposed, symptomatic, asymptomatic, hospitalized, and recovered dynamical model, along with the official COVID-19 reported data by the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia. The basic reproduction number R0 is estimated to range from 2.87 to 4.9.",
