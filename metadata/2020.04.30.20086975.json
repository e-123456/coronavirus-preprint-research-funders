    "abstract": "In this population-wide study in Ontario, Canada we report on all 194,372 unique residents who  and April 28, 2020. We found that while more women than men were tested for SARS-CoV-2, men had a higher rate of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, ICU admission and death. These findings were consistent even with age adjustment, suggesting that the observed differences in outcomes between women and men were not explained by age or systematic differences in testing by sex. Instead, they may be due to sex-based immunological or other gendered differences, such as higher rates of smoking leading to cardiovascular disease.\nCompeting Interest Statement\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.\nFunding Statement\nThis work was not funded.\nAuthor Declarations\nAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.\nYes\nAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.\nYes\nI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
