    "abstract": "In this proof-of-concept study, we model the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in various environments with a stochastic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) compartmental model. We fit this model to the latest epidemic data with an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) technique. Within this SIR-ABC framework, we extrapolate long-term infection curves for several regions and evaluate their steepness. We propose several applications and extensions of the SIR-ABC technique.",
