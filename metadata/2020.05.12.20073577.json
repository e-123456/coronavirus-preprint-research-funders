    "abstract": "To control the growing COVID-19 pandemic, increased testing and containment is essential, yet clinical-grade sampling supplies are expensive and rapidly being depleted. We demonstrate the feasibility of using alternative consumer-grade swabs stored in 95% ethanol rather than viral transport media to detect SARS-CoV-2 from ten hospitalized persons and hospital rooms.\nCompeting Interest Statement\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.",
