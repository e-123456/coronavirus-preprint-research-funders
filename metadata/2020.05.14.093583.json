    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into a worldwide pandemic. Early data suggest that the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 appear to be higher among patients with underlying cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, in cardiomyocytes, there has been no evidence of direct viral infection although the presence of inflammation and viral genome within the hearts of COVID-19 patients have been reported. Here we transduced A549 lung epithelial cells with lentivirus overexpressing selected genes of the SARS-CoV-2. We then isolated exosomes from the supernatant of A549 cells and detected the presence of viral genome within the purified exosomes. Importantly, we observed that human induced pluripotent stem cellderived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were able to actively uptake these exosomes and viral genes were subsequently detected in the cardiac cells. Accordingly, uptake of exosomes containing viral genes led to an upregulation of inflammation-related genes in hiPSC-CMs. Thus, our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA-containing exosomes represent an indirect route of entry into cardiomyocytes resulting in potential cardiac dysfunction without the need for direct viral infection.",
