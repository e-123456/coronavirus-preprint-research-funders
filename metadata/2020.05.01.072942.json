    "abstract": "Recently . However functional effects of these variants need further confirmatory studies. Moreover, mutated N & ORF1a proteins in Pakistani strains were also analyzed by 3D structure modelling, which give another dimension of comparing these alterations at amino acid level. In a nutshell, these novel variants are assumed to be linked with reduced mortality of COVID-19 in Pakistan along with other influencing factors, these novel variants would also be useful to understand the virulence of this virus and to develop indigenous vaccines and therapeutics.",
