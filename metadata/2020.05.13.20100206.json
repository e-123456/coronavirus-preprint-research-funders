    "abstract": "We prospectively compared the efficacy of PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 between paired nasopharyngeal and saliva samples in nine COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in saliva in 8 of 9 (89%) patients and in all 11 samples taken within 2 weeks after disease onset. Viral load was equivalent at earlier time points but declined in saliva than nasopharyngeal samples. PCR negativity was also concordant in all 27 saliva samples from 24 patients between nasopharyngeal and saliva samples. These results suggest that saliva is a reliable noninvasive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs and facilitate widespread PCR testing in the face of shortages of swabs and protective equipment without posing a risk to healthcare workers.",
