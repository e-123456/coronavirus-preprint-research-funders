    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and since evolved into a global threat with nearly 4.4 million infected people and over 290,000 confirmed deaths worldwide.1 SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus presenting spike (S) glycoproteins on its outer surface. Binding of S to host cell angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is thought to be critical for cellular entry. The host range of the virus extends far beyond humans and non-human primates. Natural and experimental infections have confirmed high susceptibility of cats, ferrets, and hamsters, whereas dogs, mice, rats, pigs, and chickens seem refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To investigate the reason for the variable susceptibility observed in different species, we have developed molecular descriptors to efficiently analyze our dynamic simulation models of complexes between SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2. Based on our analyses we predict that: (i) the red squirrel is likely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and (ii) specific mutations in ACE2 of dogs, rats, and mice render them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
