    "abstract": "Improper nasopharyngeal swab collection could contribute to false-negative COVID-19 results. In support of this, specimens from confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases that tested negative or indeterminate (i.e. suspected false-negatives) contained less human DNA (a stable molecular marker of sampling quality) compared to a representative pool of specimens submitted for testing.\nCompeting Interest Statement\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.",
