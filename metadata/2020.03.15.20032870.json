    "abstract": "This report describes the isolation, the molecular characterization and the phylogenetic analysis of the first three complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from three patients involved in the first outbreak of COVID-19 in Lombardy, Italy. Early molecular epidemiological tracing suggests that SARS-CoV-2 was present in Italy weeks before the first reported cases of infection.\nCompeting Interest Statement\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.",
