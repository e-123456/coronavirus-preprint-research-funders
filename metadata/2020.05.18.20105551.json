    "abstract": "This paper analyses the evolution of COVID 19 disease in Cameroon over the period March 6 April 2020 using SIR model. Specifically, 1) we evaluate the basic reproduction number of the virus. 2) Determine the peak of the infection and the spread-out period of the disease. 3) Simulate the interventions of public health authorities. Data used in this study is obtained from the Ministry of Health of Cameroon. The results suggest that over the period, the reproduction number of the COVID 19 in Cameroon is about 1.5 and the peak of the infection could occur at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected. Besides, implementation of efficient public health policies could help flattens the epidemic curve.",
