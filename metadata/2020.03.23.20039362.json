    "abstract": "COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has recently affected over 300,000 people and killed more than 10,000. The manner in which the key immune cell subsets change and their states during the course of COVID-19 remain unclear. Here, we applied single-cell technology to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the recovery stage of COVID-19. Compared with healthy controls, in patients in the early recovery stage (ERS) of COVID-19, T cells decreased remarkably, whereas monocytes increased. A detailed analysis of the monocytes revealed that there was an increased ratio of classical CD14++ monocytes with high inflammatory gene expression as well as a greater abundance of CD14++IL1B+ monocytes in the ERS. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells decreased significantly and expressed high levels of inflammatory genes in the ERS. Among the B cells, the plasma cells increased remarkably, whereas the na\u00efve B cells decreased. Our study identified several novel B cell-receptor (BCR) changes, such as IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-7, and confirmed isotypes (IGHV3-15, IGHV3-30, and IGKV3-11) previously used for virus vaccine development. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicted that IL-1\u03b2 and M-CSF may be novel candidate target genes for inflammatory storm and that TNFSF13, IL-18, IL-2 and IL-4 may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of an inflammatory immune signature in the ERS, suggesting that COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge. Our identification of novel BCR signaling may lead to the development of vaccines and antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19.",
