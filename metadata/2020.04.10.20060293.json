    "abstract": "The recent outbreak of the newly emerged novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) presents a big challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are not available while there is an increasing evidence that the epidemic is more widespread than initially thought, as well as spreading internationally across borders through travellers does already happen warranting a methodology for the rapid detection of the infection to control SARS-CoV-2. Aim: We intended to develop and deploy a robust and rapid diagnostic methodology using LAMP assay for use in point of care settings to detect SARS-COV-2 infection. Methodology: In the present study, we have developed a validated rapid diagnostic procedure to detect SARS-CoV-2 using LAMP assay, its design relying on isothermal amplification of the nucleic acids of the SARS-CoV-2. Results: The LAMP assay developed detects SARS-CoV-2 infection rapidly with high sensitivity and reliability. The data generated by LAMP assay were comparable and at par with the data generated by real-time PCR method. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that the LAMP assay developed was a rapid, reliable, sensitive and cost effective method to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in a point of care as well as in laboratory settings.",
