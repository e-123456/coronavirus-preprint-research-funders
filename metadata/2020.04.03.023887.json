    "abstract": "There is an urgent necessity of effective medication against SARS CoV2, which is producing the COVID-19 pandemic across the world. Its main protease (Mpro) represents an attractive pharmacological target due to its involvement in essential viral functions. The crystal structure of free Mpro shows a large structural resemblance with the main protease of SARS CoV (nowadays known as SARS CoV-1). Here we report that as average SARS CoV-2 Mpro is 1900% more sensitive than SARS CoV-1 Mpro in transmitting tiny structural changes across the whole protein through long-range interactions. The largest sensitivity of Mpro to structural perturbations is located exactly around the catalytic site Cys-145, and coincides with the binding site of strong inhibitors. These findings, based on a simplified representation of the protein as a residue network, may help in designing potent inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 Mpro. The main protease of the new coronavirus SARS CoV-2 represents one of the most important targets for the antiviral pharmacological actions againsts COVID-19. This enzyme is essential for the virus due to its proteolytic processing of polyproteins. Here we discover that the main protease of SARS CoV-2 is topologically very similar to that of the SARS CoV-1. This is not surprising taking into account that both proteases differ only in 12 amino acids. However, we remarkable found a topological property of SARS CoV-2 that has increased in more than 1900% repect to its SARS CoV-1 analogue. This property reflects the capacity of the new protease of transmitting perturbations across its domains using long-range interactions. Also remarkable is the fact that the amino acids displaying such increased sensitivity to perturbations are around the binding site \u2217Correspondence to estrada66@unizar.es",

        "There are some remarkable characteristics of SARS CoV-2 Mpro in relation to the protease of SARS CoV-1. They share 96% of amino acids sequence, i.e., they differ in the amino acids at only 12 out of 303 positions in the sequence. Zhang et al. [13] have reported that the superposition of the chain A of two structures corresponding to the main proteases of SARS CoV-1 and of SARS CoV-2, namely 2BX4 and 6Y2E, respectively, shows a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of only 0.53 \u00c5 for all C\u03b1 positions. The first question that emerges here is whether such similarities are also reflected at the topological structural level of the proteins. By topological we mean here the discrete topology emerging from a network theoretic representation of a protein. In this representation of the protein structure the nodes of the network represent amino acids and the edges connecting them indicate that the corresponding residues are at a distance in which they can interact to each other. Because the Euclidean distance between the amino acids is used to construct the network we more correctly should refer to this framework as topographical more than topological. This network theoretic representation has been previously used to answer several questions related to protein structure and functioning [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Among the tools in use, the one of node centrality [23, 24] has played a fundamental role (see for instance [22]. These indices capture the relative importance\u2013both structural and dynamical\u2013of an individual amino acid in the protein.",
        "The first remarkable observation of the amino acids with the largest change in the LR subgraph centrality is that they are all closely separated to each other in the three-dimensional space. For instance, the 22 amino acids displaying the largest change in this centrality form a connected subgraph of the PRN as illustrated in Fig. 4. This subgraph of 22 nodes has 48 connections among these amino acids, which produces an edge density of 0.21, almost 10 times",
        "The second remarkable feature of this subgraph is that it contains one of the two catalytic amino acids of the Mpro of SARS CoV-2, which is Cys-145. That is, the region with the largest increase in the LR subgraph centrality of the protease of SARS CoV-2 relative to SARS CoV-1 is the one enclosing the catalytic binding site of amino acid Cys-145. It is also remarkable that this region of large increment in the LR subgraph centrality contains some amino acids which are located in the binding site of the Mpro to \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitors as well as other kind of inhibitors, as we will analyze further in this work. This is the case of the residue 144-147, other amino acids in this binding site like residues 162, 163 also display large increment in the LR subgraph centrality. The last remarkable observation is that the domain III displays small change in relation to the changes of domains I and II in this topological parameter. However, as we will see in the next paragraphs this domain (residues 198-303) which is formed by 5 helices and is involved in the dimerization of the Mpro, also increases significantly the LR communicability in relation to SARS CoV-1.",
        "It is also remarkable that this subgraph is connected, which means that there is no single amino acid separated at more than 7 \u00c5 from all the rest of residues forming the subgraph. Another remarkable characteristic of these subgraphs of the most central residues according to LR subgraph centrality is that they are exactly around the binding site of the main protease. As can be seen in the Fig. 6 these subgraphs of residues are very close to the inhibitors and form a cluster of amino acids around the catalytic site, which is C145. In Table 4 we resume the results of the top ranked amino acids according to the LR subgraph centrality for the free SARS CoV-2 Mpro taken as the average of the three apo structures previously considered and the three complexes with inhibitors studied here. As can be seen the top 22 amino acids in the average free SARS CoV-2 Mpro contains more than 90% of the residues which appear involved in the interactions with the three inhibitors studied here. In the case of 6LZE they coincide in 100%, and in 6M0K the coincidence is of 95%.",
        "In this situation it is certainly remarkable that there are topological measures which change in more than 1000% from one protease to the other. These are the cases of the LR subgraph centrality of the amino acids and of the LR communicability between pairs of them. The increase of these parameters in more than 1900% for SARS CoV-2 Mpro relative to SARS CoV-1 Mpro means that the structural changes that differentiate both proteases have created a huge increment in the efficiency of SARS CoV-2 Mpro in transmitting perturbations of any kind between the amino acids of the protein using all available routes of connection and allowing for long-distance transmission. To make clearer what this sensitivity means we are going to use a simple example. Let us consider a tiny perturbation on the structure of the proteases which prevent the interaction between the amino acids P9 and G11, which have been selected at random. In SARS CoV-1 Mpro (taking 2BX4 as an example) these amino acids are at 5.69 \u00c5 and in SARS CoV-2 Mpro (taking 6Y2E as an example) they are 6.48 \u00c5 apart. Thus, in both cases they are connected in the corresponding PRN. Let us consider that the perturbation remove this edge from the PRN of both proteases. The relative decrement of the average path length in SARS CoV-2 Mpro relative to SARS CoV-1 Mpro is almost imperceptible, i.e., 5.7%. In the case of the subgraph centrality it is of the same order, i.e., 3.4%. This means that according to these parameters SARS CoV-2 Mpro is as sensitive as SARS CoV-1 Mpro to perceive a structural change in its structure produced by a given perturbation. However, when we consider the LR subgraph centrality this relative change is 316.8%. That is, according to this topological parameter which takes into account long-range interactions, SARS CoV-2 Mpro is more than three times more sensitive to a tiny structural change than SARS CoV-1 Mpro. This remarkable finding indicates that the 12 mutations produced in SARS CoV-1 Mpro makes the resulting SARS CoV2 Mpro much more efficient in transmitting \u201cinformation\u201d through the protein skeleton using short and long-range routes.is proportional to the absolute value of this difference.",
        "The second remarkable finding of the current work is that the largest changes in the LR subgraph centrality occurring in SARS CoV-2 Mpro relative to SARS CoV-1 Mpro do not spread equally across the whole structure of the protease. Instead, they are concentrated around a geometrical region which includes most of the amino acids involved in the binding site of the protease to inhibitors or close to it. One of the amino acids which has increased more dramatically its sensitivity to long-range transmission of information in SARS CoV-2 Mpro is Cys-145, which is one of the two catalytic sites of the protease, and the one involved in interactions with the inhibitors, such as the ones analyzed here. We have analyzed here three different inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 Mpro displaying very potent inhibitory capacity over the protease. In the three cases we have observed a significant variation in the LR subgraph centrality of the amino acids which were previously observed to have increased their LR sensitivity in the free protease. Therefore, these amino acids corresponds to those involved in the binding of these three inhibitors, showing that their increased topological role in the SARS CoV-2 Mpro also may play an important functional role in it."
