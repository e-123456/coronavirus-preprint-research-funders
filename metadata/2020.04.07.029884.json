    "abstract": "COVID-19 caused by the emerging human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global pandemic, leading a serious threat to human health. So far, there is none vaccines or specific antiviral drugs approved for that. Therapeutic antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, was obtained from hyper immune equine plasma in this study. Herein, SARS-CoV-2 RBD with gram level were obtained through Chinese hamster ovary cells high-density fermentation. The binding of RBD to SARS-CoV-2 receptor, human ACE2, was verified and the efficacy of RBD in vivo was tested on mice and then on horses. As a result, RBD triggered high-titer neutralizing antibodies in vivo, and immunoglobulin fragment F(ab\u2019)2 was prepared from horse antisera through removing Fc. Neutralization test demonstrated that RBD-specific F(ab\u2019)2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 at 0.07 \u03bcg/ml, showing a potent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2. These results highlights as RBD-specific F(ab\u2019)2 as therapeutic candidate for SARS-CoV-2. Keywords SARS-CoV-2; neutralizing antibody; receptor binding domain; immunoglobulin fragment; COVID-19",
