    "abstract": "An outbreak of pneumonia, caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was Identified in China in Dec 2019. This virus expanded worldwide, causing global concern. Clinical, laboratory and imaging features of this infection are characterized in some observational studies. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the frequency of clinical, laboratory, and CT features in COVID-19 patients. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis using three databases to identify clinical, laboratory, and CT features of rRT-PCR confirmed cases of COVID-19. Data for 3420 patients from 30 observational studies were included. Overall, the results showed that fever (84.2%, 95%CI 82.6-85.7), cough (62%, 95%CI 60-64), and fatigue (39.4%, 95%CI 37.2-41.6%) were the most prevalent symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Increased CRP level, decreased lymphocyte count, and increased D-dimer level were the most common laboratory findings. Among COVID-19 patients, 92% had a positive CT finding, most prevalently GGO (60%, 95%CI 58-62) and peripheral distribution (64%, 95%CI 60-69). These results demonstrate the clinical, paraclinical, and imaging features of COIVD-19.",
