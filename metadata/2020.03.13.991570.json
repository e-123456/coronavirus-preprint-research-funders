    "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, continues to spread globally, but there is currently very little understanding of the epitopes on the virus. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in complex with CR3022, a neutralizing antibody previously isolated from a convalescent SARS patient. CR3022 targets a highly conserved epitope that enables cross-reactive binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Structural modeling further demonstrates that the binding site can only be accessed when at least two RBDs on the trimeric S protein are in the \u201cup\u201d conformation. Overall, this study provides structural and molecular insight into the antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2. 34 ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY Structural study of a cross-reactive SARS antibody reveals a conserved epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain.",
