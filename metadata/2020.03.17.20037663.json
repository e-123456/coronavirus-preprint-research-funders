    "abstract": "We review the Kermack and McKendrick model of epidemics and apply it to Covid-19. Despite the simplicity of this model, solid conclusions are extracted that can assist potential decisions on the strategy to combat the outbreak, essentially configuring a scenario ranging from short-term suppression to long-term mitigation depending on the achieved reduction in the contact number.\nCompeting Interest Statement\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.",
