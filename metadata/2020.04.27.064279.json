    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in 2019 as the causative agent 3 of the novel pandemic viral disease COVID-19. With no approved therapies, this pandemic illustrates the 4 urgent need for safe, broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging 5 CoVs. We report that remdesivir (RDV), a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog, 6 potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial 7 cultures (EC50 = 0.01 \u03bcM). Weaker activity was observed in Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 1.65 \u03bcM) due to their 8 low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS9 CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, of SARS-CoV-2. In mice 10 infected with chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminished lung viral load and improved 11 pulmonary function as compared to vehicle treated animals. These data provide evidence that RDV is",
