Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV infections were observed in family clusters and hospital personnel (Chan et al., 2020; Gralinski and Menachery, 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Phan et al., 2020). The outbreak occurring during the winter is another commonality between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV (Zhou et al., 2020a)"

    "abstract": "The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is currently causing a widespread outbreak centered on Hubei province, China and is a major public health concern. Taxonomically 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it appears to share a common receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE-2). Here, we perform structural modeling of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains, which we predict to be",
