    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs mainly in China, with rapidly increasing the number of cases (namely COVID-19). Abnormal liver functions are frequently present in these patients, here we aimed to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide some references for the clinical treatment. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 to January 31, 2020. The outcomes were followed up until February 19, 2020. A total of 148 cases were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications and the length of stay. FINDINGS: Of 148 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 49.3% were females and 50.7% were males. The median age was 50.5 years (interquartile range, 36-64). Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (70.1%), cough (45.3%), expectoration (26.7%) at admission. 75 patients (50.7%) showed abnormal liver functions at admission. Patients (n = 75) who had elevated liver function index were more likely to have a moderate-high degree fever (44% vs 27.4%; p = 0.035) and significantly present in male patients (62.67% vs 38.36%; p = 0.005). The numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in abnormal liver function group than those in normal liver function group. There was no statistical difference in prehospital medications between normal and abnormal liver function groups, while the utilization rate of lopinavir/ritonavir after admission was significantly higher in patients with emerging liver injury than that in patients with normal liver functions. Importantly, the emerging abnormal liver functions after admission caused a prolonged length of stay. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 may cause the liver function damage and the Lopinavir/ritonavir should be applied carefully for the treatment of COVID-19.",
