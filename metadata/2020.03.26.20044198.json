    "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of the present study was to assess whether SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) of patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: 18 cases of COVID-19, and 5 suspected cases, were selected from three medical centers to detect the RNA expression of SARS-CoV-2 in their EPS with RT-PCR. Results: Results were negative in all EPS samples for SARS-CoV-2 of suspected and confirmed patients. Conclusions: No SARS-CoV-2 was expressed in EPS of patients with COVID-19.",
