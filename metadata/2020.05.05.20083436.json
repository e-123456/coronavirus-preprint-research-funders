    "abstract": "The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges for actively monitoring its transmission. In this study, we extend a social media mining approach used in the US to automatically identify personal reports of COVID-19 on Twitter in England, UK. The findings indicate that natural language processing and machine learning framework could help provide an early indication of the chronological and geographical distribution of COVID-19 in England.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
