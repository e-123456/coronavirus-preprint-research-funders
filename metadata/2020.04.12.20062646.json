    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection has the potential for targeting central nervous system and several neurological symptoms have been described in patients with severe respiratory distress. Here we described the case of an otherwise healthy 60-year old subject with SARS-CoV-2 infection but only mild respiratory abnormalities who developed severe progressive encephalopathy associated with mild pleocytosis and hyperproteinorrachia. MRI was negative whereas EEG showed theta waves on the anterior brain regions. Serum and CSF analyses excluded other known infectious or autoimmune disorders. The patient dramatically improved after high-doses steroid treatment suggesting an inflammatory-mediated brain involvement related to SARS-CoV-2 infection",
