    "abstract": "31 SARS-CoV-2 emerged by the end of 2019 to rapidly spread in 2020. At present, it is of utmost importance to understand the virus biology and to rapidly assess the potential of existing drugs and develop new active compounds. While some animal models for such studies are under development, most of the research is carried out in the Vero E6 cells. Here, we propose fully differentiated human airway epithelium cultures as a model for studies on the SARS-CoV-2. 36 Further, we also provide basic characteristics of the system. 37 38 Keywords: HAE, human airway epithelium, ALI, COVID-19, NCoV-2019, SARS-CoV-2, 39 coronavirus, Coronaviridae, model, culture, FISH",
