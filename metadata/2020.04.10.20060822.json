    "abstract": "In this work, we present a method to estimate the maximum limit of total cases of COVID-19 considering that the time in which the maximum number of new daily cases occurs corresponds to the inflection point of the curve described by the total number of cases that assumed to have a growth according to a logistical function in which the number of total cases at the inflection point will correspond to half of the maximum limit of total cases COVID-19. We estimate this maximum limit for China and South Korea, obtaining results compatible with the observations. And we also estimate for Italy, Germany, United Kingdom, United States and Spain.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
