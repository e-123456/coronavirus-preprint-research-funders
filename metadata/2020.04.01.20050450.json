Shanghai had a lower mean rank (P=0.175) but no significant difference. Besides, the successful prevention and control work need other effective strategies, such as real time media coverage, isolating the suspected cases or close contacts, delaying the return of work, closing schools, wearing facial masks, and disinfecting the communities, et.al.
