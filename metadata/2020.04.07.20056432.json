    "abstract": "The main purpose of the study is to introduce the wavelength models developed to measure the size of outbreaks based on the COVID-19 example. In this way, the wavelengths of the outbreaks can be calculated, ensuring that the outbreaks are valid, reliable and easy to follow at the national and international level. Wavelength models consist of approved case, death, recovered case and net wavelength models. Thus, the size of the outbreak can be measured both individually and as a whole. COVID-19 cases of 181 countries were used to demonstrate the application of the models. The prominent findings in the applied wavelength models are as follows: the countries with the highest case wavelength are USA, Italy, Spain and Germany, respectively. However, Italy ranks first in the death wavelength, followed by Spain, the USA and France. On the other hand, China has taken the first place in the recovered case wavelength. This country was followed by Spain and Germany and Italy, respectively. Based on all these wavelength models mentioned, net wavelength lengths are calculated. According to the findings of net wavelengths obtained, Canada ranked first, followed by United Kingdom, USA and Italy, respectively.",
