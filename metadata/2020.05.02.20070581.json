    "abstract": "Since the onset of the COVID-19 infection, many patients reported sudden loss of smell (SLS). However, due to the lack of psychophysical testings, it remains difficult to know if these patients really have hyposmia or anosmia. Our group investigated the prevalence of anosmia and hyposmia in 28 COVID-19 patients and the potential association with nasal complaints.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
