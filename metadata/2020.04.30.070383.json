    "abstract": "How Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections engage cellular host pathways and innate immunity in infected cells remain largely elusive. We performed an integrative proteo-transcriptomics analysis in SARS-CoV-2 infected HuH7 cells to map the cellular response to the invading virus over time. We identified four pathways, ErbB, HIF-1, mTOR and TNF signaling, among others that were markedly modulated during the course of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Western blot validation of the downstream effector molecules of these pathways revealed a significant reduction in activated S6K1 and 4E-BP1 at 72 34 hours post infection. Unlike other human respiratory viruses, we found a significant inhibition of 35 HIF-1\u03b1 through the entire time course of the infection, suggesting a crosstalk between the SARS36 CoV-2 and the mTOR/HIF-1 signaling. Further investigations are required to better understand 37 the molecular sequelae in order to guide potential therapy in the management of severe COVID38 19 patients.",
