    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 viral infection is a global pandemic disease (COVID-19). Reaching a swift, reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 in the emergency departments is imperative to direct patients to proper care and to prevent disease dissemination. COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the identification of viral RNA through RT-PCR from oral-nasopharyngeal swabs, which however presents suboptimal sensitivity and may require several hours in overstressed laboratories. These drawbacks have called for an additional, complementary first line approach. CT is the gold standard method for the detection of interstitial pneumonia, a hallmark feature of COVID-19, often present in the asymptomatic stage of the disease. Here, we show that CT scan presents a sensitivity of 95.48% (std.err=0.35%), vastly outperforming RT-PCR. Additionally, as diagnostic accuracy is influenced by disease prevalence, we argue that predictive values provide a more precise measure of CT reliability in the current pandemics. We generated a model showing that CT scan is endowed with a high negative predictive value (> 90%) and positive predictive value (69 - 84%), for the range of prevalence seen in countries with rampant dissemination. We conclude that CT is an expedite and reliable diagnostic tool to support first line triage of suspect COVID-19 patients in areas where the diffusion of the virus is widespread.",
