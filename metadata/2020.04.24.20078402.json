    "abstract": "Increased attention to analysis of SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-19) positive test frequency data is essential for achievement of better knowledge of the natural history of the virus in human populations, improved accuracy of CoV-19 epidemiological data, and development of public response policies that are better crafted to address the current CoV-19-induced global crisis. A statistical analysis of currently available positive test frequency data reveals a surprisingly uniform relationship between the number of CoV-19 test performed and the number of positive tests obtained. The uniformity is particularly striking for United States CoV-19 test data. Such observations warrant closer evaluation of other factors, besides virus spread, that may also contribute to the nature of the coronavirus pandemic. These include indigenous CoV-19 and the quality of CoV-19 testing.",
