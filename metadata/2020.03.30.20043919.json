    "abstract": "We used 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (N=444,649) to estimate the proportion of US adults who report comorbidities that suggest heightened risk of complications from COVID-19. Co-morbidities included cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and/or cancer other than skin, based on data from China. Overall 45.4% (95% CI 45.1-45.7) of adults reported any of the 6 comorbidities, increasing from 19.8% (19.1-20.4) for ages 18-29 years to 80.7% (79.5-81.8) for ages 80+ years. State rates ranged from 37.3% (36.2-38.5) in Utah to 58.7% (57.0-60.4) in West Virginia. Rates also varied by race/ethnicity, health insurance status, and employment. Excluded were residents of nursing homes or assisted living facilities. Although almost certainly an underestimate of all adults at risk due to these exclusions, these results should help in estimating healthcare needs for adults with COVID-19 complications living in the community.",
