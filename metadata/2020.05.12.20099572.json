    "abstract": "Background. Today humanity is facing another infectious threat: a newly emerging virus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. It was already described that COVID-19 mortality among elderly people and people with such underlying conditions as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes s increased. Dysregulation of the immune responses vital for antiviral defense, which are typical for chronic inflammation, led us to a hypothesis that chronic inflammation is the main risk factor for increased susceptibility and mortality from COVID-19. Method. Based on the available information for 126 countries, statistical analysis to find out whether the difference in incidence and mortality within countries can be explained by the existing chronic inflammation among the countries population, was conducted. Results. A positive correlation between the percentage of people dying from chronic noncommunicable diseases and COVID-19 incidence (p<0.001) and mortality (p<0.001) within countries. Conclusion. The problem of COVID-19-caused high mortality rate may be a consequence of the high number of people having chronic low-grade inflammation as a precondition, and thus, one of the potential ways to reduce risk of morbidity and mortality is to focus on this widespread health problem, mainly occurring in developed countries and to take corresponding diagnostic, preventative, and treatment measures.",
