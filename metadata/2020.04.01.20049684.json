    "abstract": "Data visualization is an essential tool for exploring and communicating findings in medical research, and especially in epidemiological surveillance. The COVID19-Tracker web application systematically produces daily updated data visualization and analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Spain. It collects automatically daily data on COVID-19 diagnosed cases, intensive care unit admissions, and mortality, from February 24th, 2020 onwards. Two applications have already been developed; 1) to analyze data trends and estimating short-term projections; 2) to estimate the case fatality rate, and; 3) To assess the effect of the lockdown measures on the trends of incident data. The application may help for a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic data in Spain.",
