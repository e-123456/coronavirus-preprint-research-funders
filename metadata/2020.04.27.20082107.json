    "abstract": "Preliminary reports suggest that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID\u221219) pandemic has led to disproportionate morbidity and mortality among historically disadvantaged populations. The extent to which these disparities are related to socioeconomic versus biologic factors is largely unknown. We investigate the racial and socioeconomic associations of COVID\u221219 hospitalization among 418,794 participants of the UK Biobank, of whom 549 (0.13%) had been hospitalized. Both black participants (odds ratio 3.4; 95%CI 2.4\u22124.9) and Asian participants (odds ratio 2.1; 95%CI 1.5\u22123.2) were at substantially increased risk as compared to white participants. We further observed a striking gradient in COVID\u221219 hospitalization rates according to the Townsend Deprivation Index \u2212 a composite measure of socioeconomic deprivation \u2212 and household income. Adjusting for such factors led to only modest attenuation of the increased risk in black participants, adjusted odds ratio 3.1 (95%CI 2.0\u22124.8). These observations confirm and extend earlier preliminary and lay press reports of higher morbidity in non-white individuals in the context of a large population of participants in a national biobank. The extent to which this increased risk relates to variation in pre-existing comorbidities, differences in testing or hospitalization patterns, or additional disparities in social determinants of health warrants further study.",
