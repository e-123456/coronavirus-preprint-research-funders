    "abstract": "Objectives: To assess the impact of the implemented social distancing interventions (SD) in Greece. Study Design: A dynamic, discrete time, stochastic individual-based model was developed to simulate COVID-19 transmission. Methods: We fit the transmission model to the observed trends in deaths and ICU beds use. Results: If Greece had not implemented the SD measures, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed between 30 March and 4 of April. Additionally, the SD interventions averted 4360 deaths and prevent the healthcare system from overwhelmed. Conclusions: The fast reflexes of the Greek government limit the burden of the Covid-19 outbreak.",
