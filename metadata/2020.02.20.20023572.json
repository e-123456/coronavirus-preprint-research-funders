    "abstract": "Backgrounds: An ongoing outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Covid-19) hit Wuhan and hundreds of cities, 29 territories globally. We present a method for scale estimation in dynamic while most of the researchers used static parameters. Methods: We use historical data and the SEIR model for important parameters assumption. And according to the timeline, we use dynamic parameters for infection topology network building. Also, the migration data is used for the Non-Wuhan area estimation which can be cross-validated for the Wuhan model. All data are from the public. Results: The estimated number of infections is 61,596 (95%CI: 58,344.02-64,847.98) by 25 Jan in Wuhan. And the estimation number of the imported cases from Wuhan of Guangzhou was 170 (95%CI: 161.27-179.26), infection scale in Guangzhou is 315 (95%CI: 109.20-520.79), while the imported cases are 168 and the scale of the infection is 339 published by the authority. Conclusions: Using dynamic network models and dynamic parameters for different time periods is an effective way of infection scale modeling.",
