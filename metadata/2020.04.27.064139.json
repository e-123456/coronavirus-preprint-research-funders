    "abstract": "Development of predictive quantitative models of all aspects of COVID-19 is essential for rapidly understanding the causes of differing disease outcomes and vulnerabilities, suggesting drug and therapeutic targets, and designing optimized personalized interventions. Easy to implement, predictive multiscale modeling frameworks to integrate the wide variety of clinical and research datasets into actionable insights, which could inform therapeutic regime strategies are lacking. We present a multiscale, multicellular, spatiotemporal model of the infection of epithelial tissue by a generic virus, a simplified cellular immune response and viral and immune-induced tissue damage. Our initial model is built of modular components to allow it to be easily extended and adapted in a collaborative fashion to describe specific viral infections, tissue types and immune responses. The model allows us to define three parameter regimes: where viral infection coincides with a massive cytopathic effect, where the immune system rapidly controls the virus and where the immune system controls the virus but extensive tissue damage occurs. We use the model in a proof-of-concept application to evaluate a number of drug therapy concepts. Inhibition of viral internalization and faster immune-cell recruitment lead to containment of",
