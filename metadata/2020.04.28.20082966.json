    "abstract": "Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has reached pandemic status. Drastic measures of social distancing are enforced in society and healthcare systems are being pushed to and over their limits.\nObjectives To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 by applying AI to chest CT and evaluate validation performance.\nMethods In this retrospective multi-site study, a fully automated AI framework was developed to extract radiomics features from volumetric chest CT exams to learn the detection pattern of COVID-19 patients. We analysed the data from 181 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients as well as 1200 other non-COVID-19 control patients to build and assess the performance of the model. The datasets were collected from 2 different hospital sites of the CHU Li\u00e8ge, Belgium. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity.",
