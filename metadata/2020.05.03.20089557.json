    "abstract": "Background: The evidence for the incidence and severity of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19 is still controversial. Aims: The purpose of this study was to summarize the incidence of liver injury and the differences between liver injury markers among different patients with COVID-19 in China. Methods: Computer searches of PubMed, Embase, CNKI and medRxiv were used to obtain reports on the incidence and markers of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19, from January 1, 2020 to April 10, 2020. (No. CRD42020181350) Results: A total of 57 reports from China were included, including 9889 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. The results of the meta-analysis showed that among the patients with early COVID-19 infection in China, the incidence of liver injury events was 24.7% (95% CI, 23.4%-26.4%). Liver injury in severe patients was more common than that in non-severe patients, with a risk ratio of 2.07 (95% CI, 1.77 to 2.43). Quantitative analysis showed that the severe the coronavirus infection, the higher the level of AST, ALT, TB, ALP, GGT and the lower the level of ALB. The changing trend of the appeal index was similar in ICU patients and dead patients. Conclusion: There is a certain risk of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19, and the risk and degree of liver injury are related to the severity of COVID-19.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
