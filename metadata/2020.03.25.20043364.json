    "abstract": "Background and Aims: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may affect the disease status of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aimed to assess the disease status of IBD patients in Hubei province by questionnaire online and guide to the self-management of IBD patients during this epidemic. Methods: A questionnaire was designed containing the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), the Partial Mayo Score (PMS), the short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) and distributed to Hubei IBD patients online within one month of traffic control after the outbreak of COVID-19. This questionnaire also included some questions about patients' self-report disease conditions and their epidemiological history of COVID-19. Results: A total of 102 eligible questionnaires were included in the analysis. No patient reported infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in our study. Our result showed that 69.64% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 80.44% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were in remission. There was not a statistically significant difference in the proportion of the active disease stage between the two types of disease (p=0.103). The majority of patients (85.29%) had a good health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (SIBDQ\u226550). The reduction in physical exercise is a risk factor for worsening in conditions (OR=17.593, 95%CI 2.035 to 152.097, p=0.009). Conclusions: The outbreak of COVID-19 might not have a significant impact on most Hubei IBD patients within one month after the traffic control. The patient's disease condition could be assessed by our questionnaires. Doctors utilized the information and advised for IBD patients about self-management during the period of COVID-19.",
