    "abstract": "As a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread widely and claim lives worldwide, its transmission characteristics remain uncertain. Here, we present and analyze the serial intervals-the time period between the onset of symptoms in an index (infector) case and the onset of symptoms in a secondary (infectee) case-of 339 confirmed cases of COVID-19 identified from 264 cities in mainland China prior to February 19, 2020. Here, we provide the complete dataset in both English and Chinese to support further COVID-19 research and modeling efforts.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
