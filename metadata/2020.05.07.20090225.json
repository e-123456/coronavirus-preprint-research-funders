This study aimed to survey the general public in Saudi Arabia to help in understanding their levels of anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: The researchers performed an on-line survey using snowball sampling methods from April 1 through April 10, 2020. The online survey collected demographics information data, while the Social Anxiety Questionnaire for Adults (SAQ-A30) was used to measure anxiety level. Results: This study consisted of 709 respondents from different regions of Saudi Arabia. The general population reported mild to moderate rates of anxiety. Married respondents were associated with a significantly higher level of anxiety (p<0.05). Conclusions: The respondents reported mild to moderate anxiety during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. Implication for practice: The results of this study identify the implications to lower levels of anxiety that may be used during the COVID-19 outbreak to develop mental health support programs to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
