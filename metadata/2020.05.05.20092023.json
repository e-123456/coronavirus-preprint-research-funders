    "abstract": "This study anonymously screened 13,332 individuals worldwide for psychological symptoms related to Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from March 29th to April 14th, 2020. A total of n=12,817 responses were considered valid with responses from 12 featured countries and five WHO regions. Female gender, pre-existing psychiatric condition, and prior exposure to trauma were identified as notable riskfactors, whereas optimism, ability to share concerns with family and friends like usual,positive prediction about COVID-19, and daily exercise predicted fewer psychologicalsymptoms. These results could aid in dynamic optimization of mental health services during and following the COVID-19 pandemic.",
