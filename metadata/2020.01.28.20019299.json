    "abstract": "On January 23, 2020, China quarantined Wuhan to contain an emerging coronavirus (COVID-19). We estimated the probability of transportation of COVID-19 from Wuhan to 369 cities in China before the quarantine. The expected risk is >50% in 130 (95% CI 89-190) cities and >99% in the 4 largest metropolitan areas of China.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
