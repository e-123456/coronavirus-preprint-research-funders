    "abstract": "The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presents a unique challenge for diagnostic laboratories around the world. Automation of workflows in molecular diagnostics is instrumental for coping with the large number of tests ordered by clinicians, as well as providing fast-tracked rapid testing for urgent cases. In this study we evaluated a SARS-CoV-2 LDT for the NeuMoDx 96 system, a fully automated (sample to result) RT-PCR platform offering random-access capabilities and good clinical performance for SARS-CoV-2 testing.\nCompeting Interest Statement",
