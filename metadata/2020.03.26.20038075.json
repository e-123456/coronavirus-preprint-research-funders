CFRs in the USA and Italy are similar to that in Hubei Province in the early stage of the outbreak. 3. CFRs in South Korea are similar to that outside Hubei (in China), indicating less severe outbreaks therein. 4. Our findings highlight the potential severity of outbreaks globally, particular in the USA.",
