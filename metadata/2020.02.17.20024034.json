    "abstract": "[Objective] Analyze the occurrence of novel coronavirus pneumonia(NCP) in China mainland, explore the epidemiological rules, and evaluate the effect of prevention and control. [Methods] From December 1, 2019 to March 4, 2020, Analysis of 80,409 confirmed cases of NCP in China mainland. [Results] From December 1, 2019 to March 4, 2020, a total of 80,409 cases of NCP were confirmed in China mainland, a total of 67,466 cases were confirmed in Hubei Province, a total of 49,671 cases were confirmed in Wuhan city. From December 1, 2019 to March 4, 2020, a total of 3,012 cases of NCP deaths in China mainland, the mortality was 3.75% (3012/80,409); A total of 52045 cases of cured in China mainland; The turning point of the epidemic have been reached since February 18.2020 in China mainland; The spread index of NCP gradually declined since January 27. 2020, and the extinction index of NCP rose little by little since January 29, 2020. [Conclusion] From December 1, 2019 to March 4, 2020, NCP is under control, and the trend of the epidemic will eventually disappear\uff1bThe turning point of an epidemic that I've created is a great indicator that can calculate the turning date of an outbreak and provide a basis for scientific prevention.\nCompeting Interest Statement\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.",
