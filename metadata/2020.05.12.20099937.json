    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading very rapidly across the globe because of its highly contagious nature, and is declared as a pandemic by world health organization (WHO). Scientists are endeavoring to ascertain the drugs for its efficacious treatment. Because, till now, no full-proof drug is available to cure this deadly disease. Therefore, identifying COVID-19 positive people and to quarantine them, can be an effective solution to control its spread. Many machine learning and deep learning techniques are being used quite effectively to classify positive and negative cases. In this work, a deep transfer learning-based model is proposed to classify the COVID-19 cases using chest X-rays or CT scan images of infected persons. The proposed model is based on the ensembling of DenseNet121 and SqueezeNet1.0, which is named as DeQueezeNet. The model can extract the importance of various influential features from the X-ray images, which are effectively used to classify the COVID-19 cases. The performance study of the proposed model depicts its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and precision. A comparative study has also been done with the recently published works and it is observed the performance of the proposed model is significantly better.",
