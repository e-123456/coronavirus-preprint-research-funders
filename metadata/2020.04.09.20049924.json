    "abstract": "The Coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic, which was first reported in December in Wuhan, China, has caused 3,314 death as of March 31, 2020 in China. This study aimed to investigate the temporal association between case fatality rate (CFR)\nof COVID-19 and particulate matter (PM) in Wuhan. We conducted a time series analysis to explore the temporal day-by-day associations. We found COVID-19 held higher case fatality rate with increasing concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 in temporal scale, which may affect the process of patients developed from mild to severe and finally influence the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.",
