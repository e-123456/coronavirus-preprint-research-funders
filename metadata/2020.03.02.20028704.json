    "abstract": "We monitored the transmissibility of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in Zhejiang accounting the transmissions from imported cases. Even though Zhejiang is one of the worst-affected provinces, an interruption of disease transmission (i.e. instantaneous reproduction numbers <1) was observed in early/mid-February after an early social-distancing response to the outbreak.\nCompeting Interest Statement\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.",
