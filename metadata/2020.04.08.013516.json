    "abstract": "The 2019 novel severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has caused a large number of deaths with thousands of confirmed cases worldwide. The present study followed computational approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 by its interactions with the human leukocyte antigen alleles. We identified twenty-four peptide stretches on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are well conserved among the reported strains. The S protein structure further validated the presence of predicted peptides on the surface. Out of which twenty are surface exposed and predicted to have reasonable epitope binding efficiency. The work could be useful for understanding the immunodominant regions in the surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 and could potentially help in designing some peptide-based diagnostics.",
