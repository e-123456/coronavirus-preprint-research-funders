    "abstract": "With the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, an accurate model to predict how the coronavirus pandemic will evolve becomes important and urgent to help policy makers in different countries address the epidemic outbreak and determine policies to control spread more efficiently and effectively. Unlike the classic public health and virus propagation models, this new projection model takes government intervention and public response into account to make reliable projections of the outbreak 10 days to 2 weeks in advance.\nCompeting Interest Statement\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.",
