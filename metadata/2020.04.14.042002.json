    "abstract": "Within months of the first reports [1], the COVID-19 outbreak has become a pandemic infecting and killing thousands of people worldwide [2]. COVID-19 is an infectious disease associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a Betacoronavirus that is 80% identical to the SARS-CoV virus [3]. Betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, Murine Hepatic Virus (MHV), and SARS-CoV-2, utilize the ACE2 protein for cell entry [4,5]. The Spike protein on SARS-CoV-2 has a 10 to 20 fold higher 53 affinity for the ACE2 protein than its SARS-CoV homologue [3,6].",
