    "abstract": "Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid discovery of a safe and effective vaccine is an essential issue, consequently, this study aims to predict potential COVID-19 peptide-based vaccine utilizing the Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) and Spike Glycoprotein\n(S) via the Immunoinformatics approach. To achieve this goal, several Immune Epitope\nDatabase (IEDB) tools, molecular docking, and safety prediction servers were used.",
